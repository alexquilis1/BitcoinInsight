The previous quarter, however, was upwardly revised.\nKrishna Bhimavarapu, APAC economist at State Street Global Advisors, said the data showed economic activity was restrictive enough in Australia and the Reserve Bank would not need to lift rates higher.\n“This is why we believe the next RBA move should be a cut and view a hike as an outright policy mistake,” he said.\nLocal stocks were also buoyed by a late rally into the close on Wall Street as the latest jobs data, known as JOLTS, provided further evidence the US economy was also losing momentum, keeping the door open for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nOn the benchmark, the interest rate-sensitive real estate sector was among the best performers, gaining 2 per cent alongside moves higher in the big four banks and the supermarket giants. The gains helped offset losses in energy and mining stocks.\nMiners fell 1.1 per cent as iron ore futures in Singapore touched a seven-week low near $US106 a tonne. BHP fell 0.9 per cent to $43.90, Fortescue dipped 0.8 per cent to 24.12 and Rio Tinto slipped 1.5 per cent to $125.60.\nOil also extended its losses for another session after OPEC+’s decision over the weekend to taper production cuts. The sector was off 0.9 per cent.\nCommunications stocks were the best-performing on the day – buoyed, in part, by a 4.9 per cent gain in online job marketplace Seek to $23.78 after the company agreed to sell its majority stakes in two Latin American employment market services.\nSandfire Resources, meanwhile, fell 6.1 per cent to $8.82 following an independent report into the miner’s disturbance of an Indigenous site that found the previous management failed to realise its “ESG obligations”.\nTreasury Wine Estates rallied 5.3 per cent higher at $11.99 after the group reaffirmed its forecasts ahead of an investor day in the US.\nBiotech Immutep slumped 8.9 per cent to 41¢, following a capital raise earlier this week.

Somewhere around there or even higher,\" the crypto enthusiast said on Tuesday. That indicates a 40% gain from Wednesday's price $71,500.\nAs for why, Novogratz said that in past weeks, he's been waiting for two things to catalyze a fresh rally for bitcoin.\n\"More regulatory clarity, which I thought was a low probability at that point, and\/or the Fed starting to move. We're getting the regulatory clarity,\" he said \"And even though it's not perfect, we got enough that people now realize this is coming.\"\nAlthough it remains a developing tailwind, there are clear signs that the government is changing its tune toward the industry.\nLast month, the Securities and Exchange Commission surprised markets by approving spot ether exchange-traded funds with no hassle or pushback.\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin's purchase of around $163 million worth of bitcoin ETF shares last quarter demonstrates that even institutions and pension funds are embracing digital assets, Novogratz said.\nBut an \"unbelievable positive\" is actually happening on Capitol Hill, where Democrats are less inclined to treat crypto as a political issue, he noted.\nAlthough not every party member has been anti-crypto, he said that a select few legislators have led the party's hard stance against such currencies. But now, this is changing with lobbying, and as crypto plays a larger role in election funding.\n\"The scale has gotten bigger. That's why the Democrats woke up. There's been about 150 million on its way to $250 million in these crypto Super PACs,\" he said.\nAs for the election, former president Donald Trump would seem a better fit for the industry, given his early embrace of the space, he said, but it will matter less who becomes president in the long run, given that pro-crypto rhetoric is becoming increasingly bipartisan, he argued.\nAs political obstacles clear, Novogratz expects it will lead to legislation that can spur crypto upside. For instance, if the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, known as the FIT21 bill, gets approved, that would allow big banks to pursue sales and trading of crypto, attracting a fresh wave of institutional funding, he said.\nThe proposed law looks to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for the US digital asset market."]}

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\nThe transaction comes as some of the country's biggest financial companies introduce products aimed at ordinary investors eager to put money in digital currencies.\n\"The acquisition of Bitstamp is a major step in growing our crypto business. Bitstamp's highly trusted and long-standing global exchange has shown resilience through market cycles,\" Robinhood Crypto general manager Johann Kerbrat said in the statement. He added that the acquisition will allow Robinhood to grow its footprint internationally and acquire institutional customers.\nRobinhood is an online trading platform that promotes commission-free investing. It's the equivalent of an online brokerage firm, but doesn't complete client trades. Instead, it sends them to other trading firms, that match buyers with sellers of stocks and pay Robinhood a commission on the trades.\n\"Bringing Bitstamp's platform and expertise into Robinhood's ecosystem will give users an enhanced trading experience with a continuing commitment to compliance, security and customer-centricity,\" Bitstamp CEO JB Graftieaux said in a statement.\nIndeed, Robinhood's recent profitability has been tied to its fledgling crypto business. The company reported a profit of $157 million or 18 cents per share for the first quarter, beating analyst estimates. Its profits were driven in party by high crypto trading volumes.\n\"[C]ompanies like Robinhood see there is probably a lot more growth in all things related to crypto than there is just remaining a traditional equities and options brokerage,\" Columbia Business School professor Omid Malekan, an expert on the crypto industry, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It makes sense that they are acquiring an exchange that brings with it a few different things they don't have today.\"\nAfter the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, industry giants including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton raced other players to roll out crypto ETFs. These investments allow buyers to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly owning it, among other benefits.\nMalekan expects to see more traditional brokers entering the crypto space.\n\"If you combine this acquisition and more traditional brokers partnering with crypto exchanges and the success of the bitcoin ETFs, then I think we can conclude that access to investing in crypto products is going to become much more widely available,\" he said of the Bitstamp deal. \"And it's also going to become available through service providers, or in formats people are already familiar with. There are a lot of potential investors who like getting exposure to crypto assets via traditional service providers, and Robinhood is clearly planning to expand that.\"\nChristian Catalini, founder of MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch that the deal \"marks a new chapter for crypto.\"\n\"Previously, mainstream entities only dabbled in it, but now they are placing significant bets on its future role in payments and financial services... This move is part of a broader trend of mainstream fintech players becoming crypto players, and the other way around,\" Catalini said.\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

We broke out got to [$]70[,000], we're taking a break. Like this is perfectly normal. There are kind of steps along the way. I think if it's got a 70 handle, if you're above 70, I think you own it for a trade and then some,\" Parets said.\nA $100,000 price target for bitcoin represents potential upside of 40% from current levels.\n\"I think it ultimately can go higher than that but that's sort of the next step. But step one, now we gotta clear these levels. I don't know how long it's gonna take. It could take weeks, could take months, could take years. It has yet to absorb that overhead supply so we'll see how long it takes,\" Parets said.\nThe price of bitcoin has surged over the past year after recovering from a brutal bear market in 2022.\nNow the cryptocurrency is forming a classic technical pattern, called a \"cup and handle\".\nThat's a bullish pattern that resembles a cup, formed by a basing pattern that typically looks like a \"U,\" followed by a handle that is formed by a short-term down trend.\nOnce a security breaks out above the handle, a technical analyst would buy the stock. This pattern usually extends an uptrend that is already in place.\nA trader could generate a measured move price target by measuring the depth of the cup in price, and add that amount to the lid of the cup.\nIn the case of bitcoin, it has a measured move price target of about $130,000 if the bullish cup and handle pattern materializes.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

Learn More\nToday is a historic day for Aussie cryptocurrency investors. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will be available via the ASX for the first time as the Australian Securities Exchange welcomes the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (ASX: VBTC) to its bourse.\nOther exchange-traded fund (ETF) providers have launched Bitcoin ETFs in Australia before. In May 2022, Global X Management — in partnership with 21Shares — opened the door to its Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Australia (formerly known as Chi-X).\nHowever, today's milestone marks the first of its kind for the largest stock exchange in Australia.\nThe original cryptocurrency is up 143% over the last year, fetching US$65,453 for one Bitcoin. Investors pushed the price higher in anticipation of its fourth 'halving' in April this year, reducing its further supply by 50%.\nAccording to the 2024 Finder Consumer Cryptocurrency Report, approximately a quarter of Australians have owned or are interested in owning crypto. However, obtaining it can prove difficult for some.\nVanEck Australia aims to make the journey to investing in Bitcoin easier by making the cryptocurrency available through a traditional financial product. Being an ASX-listed ETF is another important facet of the launch.\nThrough its own research, the asset manager discovered that 33% of surveyed advisers would include a Bitcoin ETF in their portfolios for clients if it were available on the ASX.\nIn describing the appeal of the spot Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Asia Pacific CEO Arian Neiron explained:\nVBTC also makes Bitcoin more accessible by managing all the back-end complexity. Understanding the technical aspects of acquiring, storing and securing digital assets is no longer necessary.\nMoreover, the new crypto investment option is being marketed as 'the most cost-effective Bitcoin fund exposure in Australia'. VanEck's product disclosure statement outlines an annual management fee of 0.59%. The Global X Bitcoin ETF carries a 1.25% management fee for comparison.\nThe term 'spot' is derived from the spot price of an asset. In other words, spot Bitcoin ETFs give the investor exposure to the underlying value of Bitcoin at market prices. Meanwhile, other 'non-spot' Bitcoin ETFs can use derivatives, such as futures contracts, to mimic the underlying asset's returns.\nVanEck is not alone in its pursuit of bringing Bitcoin to the ASX.\nReportedly, DigitalX Ltd (ASX: DCC) is hot on the heels of VanEck. The alternative wholesale fund manager is also evaluating an ASX-listed spot Ether ETF down the track.\nEditor's note: After this article was published, a reduction in the Global X 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC) management fee was announced to match VanEck's 0.59%. The reduction will take effect from 1 July 2024.\nApril 9, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nYou may have heard Bitcoin referred to as ‘digital gold’.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) fell over 4%, entering correction territory after dropping more than 14% from last week’s all-time highs.\nSEC filings on insider activity reveal that Nvidia’s CEO Jen Huang sold more than $100 million worth of shares between June 13 and June 21, 2024, marking his first sale since December 2021.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) fell over 2%, extending last week’s declines.\nAlongside Nvidia, Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MCHP) were notable laggards, dropping 9.6% and 8.3%, respectively.\nWhile the Nasdaq 100 eyes its third consecutive negative session, other major indices posted gains: the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Russell 2000 gained 0.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.9%, potentially marking its strongest session since late May.\nTreasury yields remained steady, the U.S. dollar fell 0.3%, gold prices increased 0.4% and energy-related commodities saw gains, with crude and natural gas up approximately 1% and 2%, respectively.\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell over 4% to $60,400, heading for its seventh negative session in the last eight, as the broader cryptocurrency market’s momentum remains fragile.\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\nRead Now: US Bank Stress Tests This Week, Analyst Expects Improvement: 8 Stocks, 3 ETFs To Watch\nPhoto: Shutterstock","Bitcoin plunged Monday to its lowest price since May 3, extending the midyear selloff cutting into the leading cryptocurrency’s strong returns following January’s landmark approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\nIt's been a down June for bitcoin.\nBitcoin fell by nearly 7% by 6:30 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, or 2:30 p.m. ET, trading at about $59,800 before recovering to about $60,200 shortly after (crypto price movements are typically measured in GMT as digital assets trade constantly).\nBitcoin is now down 11% in June, but remains up 42% year-to-date, with the gains largely concentrated around the ETF approval.\nThe recent losses were apparently catalyzed by anticipated sales linked to long-shuttered Japanese exchange Mt. Gox’s looming return of nearly $9 billion worth of bitcoin to creditors and the German government’s reported sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency.\nOther cryptocurrencies also slumped Monday, as Ether, Binance coin and Solana all fell 2.8% or more.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nBitcoin withdrawals at crypto exchanges outnumbered deposits by $522 million from Wednesday to Sunday, according to FactSet data, indicating a number of bitcoin holders are cashing out on their investments.\n“The crypto bears have become louder again,” Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote to clients Monday. “After months of Bitcoin ETF euphoria, the market suddenly feels bearish,” continued the Bernstein group, who maintain a highly bullish $200,000 price target for bitcoin, expecting prices to more than triple.\nBitcoin prices are up almost 300% since the end of 2022, with much of its gains stemming from hype about the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The ETFs were a crucial step for bitcoin entering the mainstream market, as legacy money managers like BlackRock and Fidelity set up low-fee funds for investors to invest directly in the price of bitcoin via typical brokerages, not having to go to crypto exchanges to directly buy bitcoin.

Bitcoin experiences significant losses following heavy outflows from exchange-traded funds. The broader currency market sees the dollar strengthening slightly, with attention on upcoming U.S. inflation data and political events in France and the U.S."],"article_contents":["The battered yen languished near the 160 per dollar level on Tuesday and kept traders on high alert for any intervention from Japanese authorities to prop up the currency, while the greenback edged a touch higher in the broader market.\nBitcoin was nursing losses after clocking its worst day in over two months at the start of the week, in part due to flows out of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), analysts said. The dollar was last 0.04% higher at 159.64 yen, just a whisker away from the 160 level that prompted a 9.79 trillion yen ($61.33 billion) currency intervention from Tokyo in late April and early May.\nThe threat of another intervention kept traders leery of testing the key resistance level, leaving the yen trading in a tight range. \"The market is showing...that they are nervous, and they are very much on edge about this situation,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\"There are inherent risks to being short the Japanese yen now as a carry trade, which is of course what (authorities) want to see. \"The first port of call is to tell currency speculators and people holding for carry that you're on notice, if you hold those positions now, you run the risk of a 400, 500-pip drop in dollar\/yen.\"\nThe latest decline in the yen has come on the back of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) June policy meeting, where policymakers disappointed investors who were betting on an immediate reduction of the BOJ's massive bond purchases. Minutes of the meeting out on Monday showed the central bank debated the chance of a near-term interest rate hike with one policymaker calling for an increase \"without too much delay\".\nIn the broader market, the dollar was on the front foot ahead of Friday's release of the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Sterling edged 0.01% lower to $1.2683, while the Australian dollar fell 0.02% to $0.6655.\nThe New Zealand dollar similarly slipped 0.04% to $0.6120, standing not too far from an over two-week low hit last week. Politics were also at the forefront of investors' minds, with the first U.S. presidential debate between President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump set for Thursday and French elections due to kick off this weekend.\nThe euro, which has come under pressure amid political turmoil in France in the wake of President Emmanuel Macron's shock snap election call earlier this month, last ticked up 0.01% to $1.0734. Still, the common currency was headed for a monthly loss of about 1%, owing to the political turmoil.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar steadied at 105.49. \"France's election will commence on June 30, hence EUR will be affected by political concerns,\" said analysts at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in a note. \"If the unstable political situation continues, EUR will weaken further against USD.\"\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was last up roughly 1.5% to $60,349, recovering some of its sharp 6.65% fall in the previous session and having hit an over one-month low. \"We've seen drawdown, we've seen six days in a row of funds coming out of the bitcoin cash ETFs,\" said Pepperstone's Weston.\n\"Bitcoin, for me, is...a momentum vehicle, and momentum works both ways. If it's going in one direction and the rate of change is picking up, for me, you stand aside and let the selling happen until it can form a base. And right now, the momentum's to the downside.\" ($1 = 159.6300 yen)\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025"]}

Bitcoin’s value in dollars reflects dynamic nature of cryptocurrency market."],"article_contents":["The stock market has largely brushed off the uncertainty around November’s US election. That may change Thursday evening, when President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump face off in the first debate in the race.\nFrom taxes and tariffs to electric cars, cryptocurrencies and more, the two candidates will be locking horns on a host of policies that can potentially send stocks swinging in various corners of the market.\n“The first presidential debate on Thursday is a good reminder for investors to keep their emotions in check and avoid making impulsive investment decisions in anticipation of election outcomes,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.\nInvestors have had a lot to contend with in recent months. Inflationary pressures remain stubbornly high, which means the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory remains unclear, and the geopolitical backdrop is growing increasingly tense. The rematch between two candidates that are so well-known by voters has resulted in tight polling results, suggesting the contest may remain too close to call even until Election Day.\nHere are the stocks and sectors in focus ahead of the widely anticipated debate between Biden and Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nEVs and Clean Energy\nTrade relations with other countries, especially China, are a major focus in this election, and will likely feature prominently in the debate. Electric vehicles, battery makers and other EV suppliers are among the groups that can see major impacts from new tariffs and any retaliatory action from China.\nBiden last month unveiled sweeping tariff hikes on a range of Chinese imports including EVs, batteries, solar cells, critical minerals, steel, aluminum and semiconductors. Trump, on his part, has talked about a 10% across-the-board tariff and steeper levies on Chinese-made goods. But risks to EV and clean energy companies do not end there. Trump has also said he will entirely reverse Biden’s EV policy.\nStocks that may move include EV-makers Tesla Inc., Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc., charging network operators such as ChargePoint Holdings Inc., Beam Global, Blink Charging Co. Solar stocks that may react include First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc. and Enphase Energy Inc.\nAsian stocks to watch include Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., which are effectively blocked from exporting directly to the US and were recently dealt another blow by the EU’s plans to hike import tariffs. Battery makers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. will also be in focus.\nSemiconductors\nChipmakers, especially those with high exposure to China, will likely swing if tariff talk escalates during the debate. Some prominent names include chipmakers Nvidia Corp., Broadcom Inc., and Qualcomm Inc.\nGiven semiconductor stocks’ — and especially Nvidia’s — outsized weighting on the S&P 500, any big move in the sector can reverberate through equities overall. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index could be particularly volatile.\nMeanwhile in Asia, Chinese chip-related shares may benefit from any potential escalation in the Sino-US chip war, which could accelerate Beijing’s push to achieving technological self-sufficiency. Watch stocks including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd.\nChina Exposure\nStocks across sectors with high China exposure will likely be volatile as trade and tariffs are hotly debated. A JPMorgan Chase & Co. index of companies with high exposure to the country included Air Products and Chemicals Inc., Celanese Corp., BorgWarner Inc., Otis Worldwide Corp., Agilent Technologies Inc., IPG Photonics Corp. and Jabil Inc., among others.\nCrypto and Financials\nTrump’s recent ardent courting of Bitcoin miners and his enthusiastic stance on cryptocurrency have put the group under the spotlight. Given stocks related to cryptocurrency typically are a pretty volatile bunch, any prominent mention or promise of a specific regulatory action or policy can spark big moves.\nStocks to watch include Coinbase Global Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Platforms Inc., Cleanspark Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and Cipher Mining Inc., as well as the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF.\nTraditional Energy\nTrump has said he plans to roll back restrictions on domestic oil production, and has a generally pro-oil stance. Further promises on that front can boost stocks like Baker Hughes Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum Corp., among others.\nOther Potential Topics\nDefense can be a big topic given conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and stocks to watch include Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and RTX Corp. Access to cannabis has remained a political issue, and thus may creep into the debate as well. Watch Tilray Brands Inc., Canopy Growth Corp., and Curaleaf Holdings Inc., as well as the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF.\nIn a similar vein, gun rights are another highly divisive issue, and can come up during the debate. Smith & Wesson Brands and Sturm Ruger & Co. may move. Drugmakers are “a target of populists in both parties,” according to Stifel’s chief Washington policy strategist, Brian Gardner. Watch the big pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly & Co., as well as the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF.\nCurrency Woes\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have so far been fairly united over a hawkish view on China, and as such investors will be monitoring candidates’ language for a further toughening of that stance. With the Chinese yuan already close to the weak end of its daily trading band, further tariff-related depreciation in the local currency will test the People’s Bank of China’s resolve to manage the currency weakness.\n“If tariff rhetoric becomes even harsher or if other measures such as tougher restrictions on investing in China are brought up, we believe USD\/CNH will be under greater upward pressure towards the previous high in 7.35-7.40,” Citigroup Inc. economists including Daniel Tobon wrote in a note on Wednesday.\nMarket watchers will also be gauging the likelihood of a Trump victory, which if coupled with a Republican-controlled Congress, is expected to see a surge in Treasury yields and boost the greenback. Key Asian currencies are already testing multi-year lows against the dollar, with the won falling toward the key 1,400 level, while the yen this week blew past a threshold where officials intervened in the market in April. This will raise the risk of currency intervention from South Korean and Japanese authorities. Similarly, central banks in India and Indonesia have been actively supporting their domestic currencies, as the rupiah and rupee hover close to record lows against the greenback.\nWith assistance from Marcus Wong and John Cheng.\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.
