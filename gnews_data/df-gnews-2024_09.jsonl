This concern is particularly relevant as more players enter the space, each with their own strategies and cost structures.\nRob Chang, CEO of Gryphon Digital Mining (NASDAQ: GRYP), responded by shedding light on his company’s unique approach.\n\"Our electricity costs are extremely low, at around 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, thanks to our location in an area with little demand,\" Chang explains. This strategic positioning allows Gryphon to pass through costs directly, enabling them to maintain profitability even when Bitcoin prices drop. He adds, \"When Bitcoin drops to $40,000 $30,000 or even $20,000, our costs flex down as well,\" highlighting the importance of flexibility in their business model.\nThis adaptive cost structure has proven to be a significant advantage for Gryphon. Reflecting on past market downturns, Chang notes, \"We were actually doing quite well because our costs were flexing way down and it was very advantageous for us.\" While many of their competitors struggled during Bitcoin's slump, Gryphon's ability to adjust its expenses allowed the company to remain resilient, underscoring the importance of flexibility in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nAs that competition grows, more and more bitcoin miners have been drawn to mining other cryptocurrencies or expanding into AI data centers."]}

But the cryptocurrency’s prices started to come down in late August and have continued to falter in the first days of September.\n“September has traditionally been a volatile month for bitcoin, with an average return of 4.78% and a typical peak-to-trough decline of 24.6%,” analysts with the Bitfinex crypto exchange told Forbes via email.\nInvestors have been hoping the Federal Reserve will issue rate cuts during its two-day meeting in September and deliver a soft landing for the economy.\nIf the Fed issues the highly anticipated cuts, Bitcoin could tumble below $40,000 again, Bitfinex analysts warned.\nBitcoin is typically a volatile stock in September during an end-of-summer trading lull, and rate cuts would only worsen this volatility, analysts said.\nSeptember rate cuts seem more likely than ever after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell came off more dovish than expected during his Jackson Hole speech, which sent the US dollar falling further.\n“It’s been a tough summer for the greenback,” Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics, told Forbes via email. “As recently as April, dollar dominance looked unstoppable as its price soared versus almost all global currencies. Now it’s at 2024 lows against the euro, the pound and the yen.”\nFederal Reserve July meeting minutes showed they might cut rates more than initially expected after a series of pandemic-induced rate hikes that propelled rates to 23-year highs.\nRoarty reaffirmed that interest rates might fall faster than expected – by as many as 100 basis points by the end of the year.\nHe said investors should keep an eye on how other central bankers – like the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan – react, specifically the difference between their interest rates and the rates in the US.\n“That all important rate gap…could be the driver of some significant currency volatility over the coming months,” Roarty said. “Strap in for what could be a bumpy ride.”\nThe European Central Bank and the Bank of England are both expected to continue making rate cuts.\nInvestors remain unsure about the next move from the Bank of Japan, which acted as the catalyst for a steep market sell-off in July after issuing a surprise interest rate hike.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin prices have dropped off from strong growth during the first half of the year.\n“While we remain optimistic about digital assets’ mid- to long-term prospects, the current evidence calls for caution,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, wrote in a note.\nAlthough the market bounced back in V-shaped rebounds after dips in May, July and August, each dip has become deeper and each recovery has become meeker, Thielen said.\n“The latest end-of-month data indicates that we may be nearing a critical tipping point in September, marked by a decline in demand,” he said.\nBut other analysts have focused on Bitcoin’s historically poor performance in September and argued that rate cuts could actually help the cryptocurrency’s performance.\nData shows Bitcoin has an average value depletion rate of 6.56% in September, Innokenty Isers, founder of UK-based crypto exchange Paybis, told Forbes via email.\nIsers argued that rate cuts – which typically increase US dollar flow, thus weakening the value of the dollar – could make Bitcoin seem like a healthy alternative.\n“If the Fed’s policies weaken the dollar, switching to risk assets with higher growth potential might be inevitable,” he said.\nHe said the popularity of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could also bolster Bitcoin’s performance in September.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission greenlit the ETFs – which allow investors to acquire stakes in funds that own Bitcoin offered by firms including Blackrock and Fidelity – early this year after a decade-long battle with the crypto industry.\nThe ETFs were a massive hit, spearheading a trading frenzy and driving Bitcoin prices above $60,000 for the first time in two years in February.\nThe Bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock and Fidelity are some of the fastest-growing ETFs in history.\nAdvertisement","September has historically been a tough month for the cryptocurrency market, with negative returns in eight of the past eleven years since 2013. This recurring pattern has made investors cautious during this time of year.\nHowever, recent market signals indicate that this trend might be on the verge of changing. Growing optimism surrounds the possibility that the Federal Reserve could soon lower interest rates—a move that would likely inject fresh momentum into the crypto market.\nIf the expected rate cuts materialize, they could help the crypto market overcome its usual September slump and potentially deliver positive returns, breaking free from its historical struggles.\nLet’s see what this week holds for crypto investors.\n2 \/ 7\nUniswap (UNI), the native token of the decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, has seen a notable increase of over 4% in value over the past week. This surge can be largely attributed to Uniswap’s recent partnership with the popular NFT project, Pudgy Penguins, which was highlighted during Korea Blockchain Week. Pudgy Penguins, a collection of 8,888 distinctive NFTs launched on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2021, has garnered significant attention in the NFT space.\nIn a nod to the collaboration, Uniswap Labs has updated its X (formerly Twitter) account avatar to feature a playful penguin donning a unicorn hat, blending both brands’ mascots in a whimsical way.\nAs of now, Uniswap is trading at approximately $6 per token, reflecting growing investor interest driven by these recent developments.\n3 \/ 7\nEarlier this year, Monero (XMR), a prominent privacy-focused cryptocurrency, faced setbacks when it was delisted from Binance and several other major crypto exchanges for failing to meet regulatory standards. This move led to a sharp decline in Monero’s price, raising concerns about its future.\nHowever, despite these challenges, Monero has recently shown signs of resilience and growth. The cryptocurrency has experienced a surge in value in recent days, driven by the introduction of a new privacy feature called Full-Chain Membership Proofs (FCMP++). This advanced integration is designed to significantly bolster transaction security and privacy on the Monero network.\nOver the past week, Monero has gained more than 9% in value, and it is currently trading at around $174 per coin, reflecting renewed confidence from investors amid the network’s continued development.\n4 \/ 7\nAave’s (AAVE) bullish momentum is largely driven by the launch of Sky Aave Force, a strategic partnership between prominent DeFi titans Sky and Aave, designed to accelerate growth within the decentralized finance sector. The aim of this union is to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional financial systems.\nIn addition to the positive sentiment generated by this partnership, on-chain data reveals a rise in both AAVE’s open interest and daily active addresses. As a result, Aave has seen nearly 5% growth over the past week, with the token currently trading at $132, reflecting the market’s growing confidence in the project’s future potential.\n5 \/ 7\nMantra (OM) is a specialized blockchain network dedicated to the issuance, trading, and secure management of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). These assets encompass a wide range of categories, including real estate, private equity, artwork, and treasuries. By enabling the tokenization of these tangible assets, Mantra is bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, offering investors a more accessible and secure way to diversify their portfolios.\nRecently, Mantra Chain made headlines by partnering with MAG Group, a major real estate developer, to tokenize $500 million worth of real estate assets. This significant development has fueled a surge in Mantra’s cryptocurrency, OM, as investor interest intensifies and analysts are also predicting a potential price breakout.\nWith nearly 7% growth in the past week, OM is currently trading at $0.97, signaling strong market confidence and the possibility of even greater gains ahead.\n6 \/ 7\nThe recent surge in the Solana-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) can be attributed to significant whale activity, indicating renewed investor confidence in the token’s potential. Over the past few days, one whale has accumulated over 9.57 million WIF tokens, valued at $13.59 million. This large purchase was followed by another whale who used 1.4 million USDC to acquire 643,832 WIF tokens, making them the largest holder with a total of 28.66 million tokens.\nWhile Dogwifhat is still down nearly 10% over the past week, the coin has experienced a 6% uptick in the last 24 hours. Currently trading at $1.50, the cryptocurrency appears to be regaining momentum as investors eye its potential for further growth.\n7 \/ 7","03rd Sep, 2024. 03:25 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 8, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 16452065.15 on 3 September 2024.\n1 BTC = 16452065.15 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

Several factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s stalled momentum, but a key reason is its growing correlation with macroeconomic conditions. As Bitcoin matures, it is becoming more susceptible to the influences of global market dynamics and economic factors, which now play a larger role in shaping its trajectory than in the past.\nBitcoin made a major comeback in 2024 after suffering through a prolonged crypto winter brought about by FTX’s collapse. It underwent a major technical event known as “the halving” and is increasingly gaining mainstream acceptance. Following the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs from the SEC, the leading cryptocurrency peaked at $73,737 in March.\nAdam Back, a prominent figure in the crypto world and one of the earliest cypherpunks who helped establish Bitcoin’s ideological foundation, said Bitcoin’s rise to the $100,000 mark is long overdue and should happen soon.\nHowever, it appears unlikely that the leading cryptocurrency will reach the $100,000 mark or even come close to it in 2024. This is primarily due to the complexities involved, making it a challenging feat to achieve.\nCrypto expert Noelle Acheson believes that Bitcoin can cross the $100,000 mark—it’s just not likely to happen this year. In an email, she told Quartz that if the political uncertainty is resolved favorably—for example, if former President Donald Trump wins in November or if Vice President Kamala Harris expresses support for crypto development—then it is certainly possible, especially given the likelihood of an easing interest rate cycle.\n“I’m not saying it will happen [this year], just that it’s not an outrageous prediction.”\nJag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at the crypto exchange Bitfinex (LEO), echoed Acheson’s statement by saying that, based on historical patterns and the expectations set by events like halvings, Bitcoin could reach $100,000.\n“However, these forecasts often fail to account for unexpected macroeconomic shifts, the market’s maturation, and changes in investor behavior,” he stated in an email.\nAfter the Bitcoin halving in April, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency did not experience the significant price surge seen in previous halvings.\nAcheson noted that halving events often lead to a temporary decline in Bitcoin’s price in the months that follow, so the current sluggishness is not unexpected. However, this year presents a unique set of circumstances.\n“This year is weaker than other cycles, however, most likely due to the political factors and to the AI frenzy,” she added.\nKooner attributed the current market’s complexity to various factors, including institutional investment patterns, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions affecting Bitcoin price performance.\n“There is always a ‘buffer period’ post halving that usually occurs,” he added.\n“While the immediate aftermath of the halving has seen some volatility, this period might represent a typical post-halving re-accumulation phase, which has been observed in previous cycles.”\nAcheson refrained from making specific price predictions for Bitcoin in 2024 but highlighted an intriguing historical pattern. She pointed out that between the end of August and December 2020, following the previous halving, Bitcoin’s price surged by 270%. Within the same time frame, for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by the end of this year, it would only need to rise by 70%, she said.\nKooner considers the $63,000 to $65,000 range crucial for Bitcoin’s market dynamics. He views Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its price above or below this level as a key indicator of market strength, as it reflects the cost basis for short-term holders and ETF buyers.\n“We also expect some traditional finance de-risking and a sell-the-news event causing a price decline post the actual rate cut in September. However, as long as equities hold up well in Q4 2024, we expect the consolidation period to be over by then,” he added.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Date:\nShare post:\nOver the past few years, cryptocurrency has cemented its role as a prominent force in the financial world, increasingly becoming a staple in many investors’ portfolios.

Bitcoin’s value in dollars reflects the dynamic nature of the crypto"],"article_contents":["Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds had their worst day in over four months on Tuesday as investors pulled some of their money alongside a broader market selloff.\nMore than $287 million was withdrawn from the 11 U.S.-listed ETFs, the biggest day for outflows since May 1, according to Farside Investors data. The funds hit the market in January, following a ruling by the SEC that allowed financial firms to package bitcoin into ETFs, the same way they do for stocks and bonds.\nFidelity led redemptions, with investors on Tuesday selling more than $162 million worth of shares in its FBTC fund. Grayscale, which has seen net outflows of more than $19.8 billion since converting its trust to an ETF in January, recorded outflows of $50.4 million. The fund issued by Ark 21Shares had outflows of $33.6 million, and investors sold $25 million worth of shares in Bitwise's BITB offering.\nMuch of the initial enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin ETFs has dissipated in the last few months, following a blockbuster debut that broke records for the ETF market. Spot bitcoin funds now hold a total of around $52.6 billion in assets under management, $10 billion off their peak.\nA large portion of the decline is due to the drop in the price of bitcoin, which reached a record at over $73,000 in March and has since slid to about $58,400. Bitcoin fell almost 3% on Tuesday, which was also a down day for equities after weak manufacturing data stoked fears of an economic slowdown. It was the fifth consecutive day of redemptions across the spot funds.\nSpot ether ETFs, which launched in July, have also experienced a rough months. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency plunged almost 6%, leading to outflows in the related ETFs. JPMorgan analysts noted that redemptions \"were entirely driven by Grayscale,\" as investors unloaded more than $52 million worth of shares in its ETHE product.\nOverall, flows have been tepid. Other than inflows of $4.9 million into Fidelity's spot ether product, all other funds were flat for the day. The total assets of the spot funds is down to around $6.7 billion from $10.2 billion in July.\nAs of the end of the second quarter, Wall Street banks and hedge funds were buyers of bitcoin ETFs. Data regarding ether ETF purchases won't show up until the next round of filings.\nQuarterly disclosures with the SEC showed that institutional ownership of spot bitcoin ETFs rose to 24% by the end of the quarter, according to a note from analysts at H.C. Wainwright.\nGoldman Sachs made its debut in the crypto ETF market in the period, purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds.\nMorgan Stanley started earlier but reduced its holdings in the latest quarter. Of the investment bank's $1.5 trillion in assets under management, it held $189 million worth of spot bitcoin ETFs, down from roughly $270 million in the prior period.\nWATCH: Crypto's election influence","Bitcoin plunged deep into the red Wednesday morning, dropping nearly 4% to $56,000, as a massive sell-off in the stock market followed disappointing U.S. macroeconomic data. The ripple effect was felt across the crypto market, with Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, losing nearly 3% and hovering around $2,300.\nOther major cryptocurrencies also saw significant declines, with BNB, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano shedding over 7%, 4%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. Overall, the global crypto market was down 3.3%, with total market capitalization slipping to $1.98 trillion.\nThe latest economic data indicating sluggish U.S. manufacturing activity in August has caused investors to be concerned about the health of the U.S. economy. This week’s upcoming job reports are particularly anticipated, as they could provide key insights into the Fed’s next move on interest rates in September.\nAmid this uncertainty, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, shared his perspective in an email to Quartz. He pointed out that the “sell the news” effect—a trading strategy where investors sell assets following the anticipation of a significant event—is currently in play. According to Lee, short-term market sentiment and investor behavior could indeed exert downward pressure on Bitcoin and other assets, as investors often take profits after positive news materializes, leading to a temporary market decline.\nHowever, Lee also emphasized that while a potential rate cut might trigger a short-term pullback, the market is likely to recover in the long run. He believes that a more accommodative monetary policy could ultimately benefit the market, paving the way for a stronger recovery down the line.\n“Investors should consider this distinction when formulating investment strategies, rather than focusing solely on short-term price fluctuations,” he added.\nInvestors are steering clear of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen consistent outflows for the past week. According to ETF tracker Farside, since August 27, these funds have experienced cumulative outflows totaling $767.6 million. The ongoing outflows reflect broader market uncertainty and hesitation around digital assets, even as the industry awaits potential catalysts for a reversal in sentiment.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","In this article\nBitcoin slid back toward $55,000 overnight as it caught up with Tuesday's broader market sell-off.\nOn Wednesday, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency hovered above the flat line at $58,063.41, according to Coin Metrics. It fell sharply Tuesday night — to as low as $55,673.80 — with the start of Asia-Pacific trading but has stabilized since then.\nTech stocks struggled in U.S. trading Tuesday, with the sector coming off its worst day since September 2022, while two readings of manufacturing production showed signs of weakness, rekindling fears about the health of the economy. Japan's Nikkei 225 and the broad-based Topix finished Wednesday trading with their worst one-day loss since the Aug. 5 sell-off.\nLately, bitcoin's moves are sometimes more muted than stocks' during U.S. hours on big market days. James Davies, co-founder at crypto trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange, explained that traders react \"more dynamically\" to macro events during Asia trading.\n\"U.S. crypto trading accounts for around 30% of global volume, but it's largely driven by institutional activity, especially in derivatives like CME futures, which are often less reactive to immediate market trends they have seen coming,\" he said. \"In contrast, the Asian market, contributing close to 50% of global volume, is more retail-focused.

August private job growth hit a 3-1\/2 year low, prompting economists to predict an increase of 165,000 jobs for August.\nAdam Button, chief currency analyst at Forexlive, described a market unsure of the scale of rate cuts needed.

The market experienced a $1 trillion reduction in total market cap. The Dow fell by over 600 points, while the Nasdaq dropped by 3%. Nvidia, a leading semiconductor company, was hit hard, with its stock down more than 7%. This was the largest one-day market cap decline for any U.S. company. This decline also led to a personal loss for Nvidia's CEO, who saw a $10 billion reduction in net worth. Bitcoin also fell below $56,000 but has since recovered slightly to around $58,000.

The CFTC found that Uniswap Labs provided leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions in cryptocurrencies without proper registration.

The fine was reduced due to Uniswap Labs' cooperation with the investigation.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs saw big outflows on Tuesday, with $287.78 million withdrawn, marking the largest outflow since May 1. Spot Ethereum ETFs also experienced outflows totaling $47.4 million.\nThe FBI has issued a warning about North Korean cybercriminals intensifying efforts to hack U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital tumbled 20%. A basket of crypto-related equities tracked by Schwab fell to its lowest level since February.\nThe industrywide selloff reflected growing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy and tracked a broader decline in prices of bitcoin, ether and risky assets in general. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 5.8% for the week, its worst performance since January 2022.\nIn addition to macro pressures, the calendar is doing crypto no favors. According to CoinGlass, September is historically a difficult trading month for crypto assets, with bitcoin notching an average loss of 4.8%. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a gauge of crypto market sentiment, is firmly in the \"Extreme Fear\" zone, indicating that investors are worried about price moves.\nBitcoin slipped to its lowest level since February, falling 4% in the last 24 hours to around $54,000.\nIn a week shortened by the Labor Day holiday, Tuesday saw the steepest selloff in the broader market after weak manufacturing data stoked fears of an economic slowdown. The 11 U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds had their worst day in over four months after the report, as more than $287 million was collectively withdrawn from the ETFs.\nThe data was bad through the end of the week. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a cooldown in the labor market with August payrolls falling short of expectations.\n\"The recent U.S. labor market results acted as a moment of truth for risk-on assets like bitcoin, as the labor market is considered the main sector that may influence the Fed's decision to cut rates this month,\" said Leena ElDeeb, a research analyst with ETF issuer 21Shares, in an email.\nThe total market cap of crypto is down close to 30% from its 2024 peak of $2.67 trillion, and is now at $1.9 trillion. Altcoins like Solana's SOL token, XRP and Cardano's ADA all dropped more than 8% in the past week. Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, plunged 12% to around $2,200.\nWhile it was a rough week for risky assets of all sorts, investors over-indexed in crypto stocks had it particularly bad.\nSchwab Asset Management's crypto-themed ETF (STCE), which includes MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Coinbase, fell 11%.\nCoinbase, stuck in a court battle with the SEC over whether the exchange engages in unregistered sales of securities, plummeted 20% to its lowest since February. MicroStrategy, the bitcoin collecting company founded by Michael Saylor, dropped 14% for the week on the heels of a 12% slide the previous week.\nThe top bitcoin mining companies all ended the week with double-digit declines, led by CleanSpark's 24% plunge. Riot Platforms lost 17%.\nThe downward slide is a continuation from last month. However, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note on Friday, citing TradingView estimates, that even as token and asset prices suffered dramatic drops, trading increased in August, with total average daily volumes up 8% from the previous month.\nAs investors turn to what's coming, one big area of focus is the Federal Reserve.\nThe central bank could cut its benchmark for the first time in four years, when it meets Sept. 17-18. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that \"the time has come\" for interest-rate policy to adjust. Analysts anticipate either a 0.25% or 0.5% reduction from the current rate of 5.25%-5.5%.\nLooser monetary policy is typically a good thing for risky assets like crypto, which tend to see more investor inflows when borrowing costs drop.\nThe latest read on inflation comes Wednesday with August's Consumer Price Index. The readout is another key metric the Fed will consider ahead of its September meeting.\nThe U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday might also prove a price driver in the crypto markets. Republican nominee Donald Trump has branded himself as the pro-crypto candidate for president and recently headlined the biggest bitcoin event of the year in Nashville. Many in the industry see a potential second Trump presidency as a catalyst for the industry, in part because he has vowed to remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who's long been viewed as a crypto skeptic.\nWATCH: How Trump was 'orange-pilled'","06th Sep, 2024. 02:52 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 15556481.51 on 6 September 2024.\n1 BTC = 15556481.51 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

Earlier, it rose as much as 9%. XRP, which was created by the founders of Ripple, is the native token of the open source XRP Ledger, which Ripple uses in its cross-border payments business. It is the fifth-largest coin by market cap, excluding stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USDC.\nUnlike an exchange-traded fund, the trust will primarily trade over the counter. Trusts are also more susceptible to trading at a price that does not line up with the underlying value of the portfolio.\n\"As crypto investors diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, we believe in providing exposure to protocols that solve real-world problems,\" Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale's head of product and research, said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"XRP can reduce frictions in international payments, enabling more efficiency in an evolving global economy.\"\nRipple, the largest holder of XRP coins, scored a partial victory last summer after a three-year battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not considered a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, but it is considered an unregistered security offering if sold to institutional investors. This was hailed as a landmark win for the crypto industry.\nGrayscale also made history shortly after when a court ruled that the SEC was wrong to deny the crypto investment giant permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust into an ETF. The agency approved the necessary rule change in January. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust began trading in January and July of this year, respectively, as ETFs.\nMajor cryptocurrencies were flat on Thursday. Bitcoin was last trading at $58,382.10 and ether at $2,360. MicroStrategy added more than 1%.

According to Kendrick, the current supply is around 1% of all bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n\"This is similar to the amounts of BTC held by MicroStrategy and by BlackRock's ETF, the two largest known BTC holdings,\" the global head of digital assets research wrote.\nTrump's pro-crypto switch was especially evident when he faced off against President Joe Biden, whose administration was more stringent toward the industry.\nBut compared to Biden, current Democratic candidate Kamala Harris will be more open to crypto than some suspect, Kendrick suggests.\nFor instance, where Biden kept in place a bill that prevents banks from providing digital asset custody, Harris would likely shift course.\nIf Harris wins the presidency, bitcoin will reach $75,000 by the end of the year, Kendrick estimates. Though nowhere near Trump's outcome, that still surpasses bitcoin's all-time high of nearly $74,000.\n\"In the event of a Harris victory, we think BTC would head higher after an initial dip, once the market recognizes that regulatory change is still likely under Harris, even if at a slower pace,\" he said.\nIn line with this forecast, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani similarly expects bitcoin to surge under Trump, as the market has yet to price in a positive regulatory environment.\nHe predicts the currency will reach as high as $90,000 by December.\nMeanwhile, Kendrick cited other bitcoin-positives in the months ahead. The currency should benefit from the Treasury yields re-steepening, while momentum returns to the bitcoin ETFs.\nAlthough inflows were week in the last few months, momentum tends to be seasonal, Kendrick said, adding that risk sentiment was low this summer.\nEven if Trump wins, Kendrick tempered his prior outlook that bitcoin can reach $150,000 by the year's end. However, he maintains that it will hit $200,000 by the end of next year, regardless of who is president.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

Securities Commission hearing panel has issued a $500,000 fine against a banned, unregistered and unauthorized crypto trading platform based in the Cayman Islands while also barring it from promotional activities in B.C.\nThe Sept. 17 sanctions decision provides another example of how provincial commissions are attempting to regulate crypto exchanges.\nLiquiTrade Ltd. had been operating a trading platform named Latoken, which the commission’s executive director claimed was marketed to B.C. residents.\nMany foreign cryptocurrency exchanges — as in the case of LiquiTrade — do not sell cryptocurrency assets, but instead offer contractual rights to those assets, thus making them derivatives and subject to securities rules.\nAs such, cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with a provincial securities regulator in Canada and follow certain guidelines.\nIn July, a hearing panel ruled LiquiTrade was operating in B.C. without authorization. At the time, commission investigators claimed they were able to register on the platform from their computers using a B.C. Internet protocol (IP) address.\nThe sanctions decision revealed the platform has since barred accounts that use B.C.-based telephone numbers and IP addresses from registering, although investigators told the panel they could still start an account using virtual private network (VPN) software.\nThe panel reserved judgment on the VPN issue, stating: “We agree that the mitigating factor or LiquiTrade’s subsequent change of behaviour is a moderate mitigating factor. However, we emphasize that we are not expressing a conclusion about whether a failure by LiquiTrade to preclude British Columbia residents from accessing its exchange using a masked IP address is a breach of the Act.”\nThe panel also noted, “there is no evidence that any individual investor lost funds as a result of LiquiTrade’s conduct” and that “the executive director concedes that it appears likely the number of British Columbia users of LiquiTrade was relatively small.”\nA report from Inca Digital, Inc., commissioned by the Ontario Securities Commission on April 26, 2022, found that 0.79 per cent of all visits to the LiquiTrade website from web traffic information and social media sites were from Canadians, the panel noted in its decision.\nThe panel’s written decision outlined why regulators are tackling crypto exchanges, especially unregistered foreign ones.\n“The prices of many crypto assets are highly volatile and investments in such assets carry a high degree of risk. In addition, some markets and platforms for trading in crypto assets have fewer controls than others.\n“The Commission, in coordination with other securities regulators in Canada, has sought to mitigate many of those risks by imposing various requirements of entities which, among other things, facilitate trades in crypto assets for local residents. Those requirements and risk mitigation measures are of no value if they are ignored.”\nSomething not mentioned by the panel is the use of trading platforms by fraudsters.\nThe commission, to date, has found many companies have not responded to hearing notices and those that have been banned in Canada may still offer accounts to British Columbians.\nLiquiTrade never responded to the commission’s notice, nor did it make submissions on sanctions or otherwise participate in the sanctions hearing.\nThe decision is found online.\n[email protected]","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe future of global liquidity and its potential impact on bitcoin was the central topic discussed in a recent conversation with investor Lyn Alden.\nAustin Arnold, Co-Host of Altcoin Daily, spoke with Alden to gain insight into how monetary policies and economic shifts could shape bitcoin’s performance over the next 18 months.\nAlden noted, “We are generally seeing, as the Fed starts to cut interest rates, a softer dollar.” She explained that while the U.S. dollar benefits from being the global reserve currency, \"whenever we ease monetary policy, that tends to be pretty dovish for the dollar.” Alden predicted a weaker dollar and a return to global credit creation, forecasting, “we're entering another upward liquidity cycle after really two plus years of being range bound in liquidity.”\nOn bitcoin’s prospects, Alden expressed optimism, citing its connection to liquidity cycles. “Bitcoin has followed this liquidity cycle pretty closely, and my base case over the next 18 months is probably for both liquidity and bitcoin to go up,” she said. However, she admitted that short-term predictions are difficult, stating, “I don’t really have a view of say the next three to six months.”\nWhen Arnold asked about her base, bear, and bull cases for bitcoin, Alden remarked, “I’d be surprised if we don’t see a $100,000,” while cautioning that external factors such as institutional buy-ins or sovereign announcements could heavily influence price movements.\nAlden concluded by emphasizing the importance of focusing on long-term trends over specific price targets. She highlighted how decisions from major institutions or nation states could have a significant impact on bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming years.\nCheck out the full interview on Altcoin Daily's YouTube channel here.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAs bitcoin evolves and institutional investors take a larger role in the market, the relevance of traditional terms are being questioned. Perhaps, even, bitcoin may not be the market hedge it once was.\nWith its market behavior diverging from established patterns, the cryptocurrency is entering uncharted territory.\nThis topic was discussed by Roundtable anchor, Rob Nelson; David Gokhshtein, founder of Gokhshtein Media; and Sue Ennis, head of investor relations at Hut 8, as they explored how bitcoin’s changing dynamics are reshaping market perceptions.\nRob Nelson began by questioning whether these traditional terms still hold for bitcoin, stating, \"I'm almost wondering if those terms don't adequately apply anymore.\" He noted that bitcoin behaves differently from conventional assets, prompting further discussion on its unique position.\nDavid Gokhshtein emphasized the significant impact of institutional involvement, saying, \"We're just in a different market... the institutional players are here.\" He explained that firms like BlackRock and Fidelity now dictate the market's pace, which contrasts with the cycles driven by retail investors in previous years. Gokhshtein also suggested that bitcoin is in the \"disbelief stage,\" similar to when gold’s ETF was first approved.\nSue Ennis agreed that institutional influence is stabilizing the market, remarking, \"We're not going to see as much extreme swings.\" She highlighted how bitcoin is shifting from a speculative asset to a key component of institutional portfolios, resulting in more controlled movements.\nEnnis also pointed to the broader economic environment, noting September's historically difficult trading conditions and upcoming factors like interest rate decisions and the 2024 election. She believes these elements are causing market uncertainty, but that a clearer direction for bitcoin will soon emerge.","President Donald Trump said this week Jerome Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.”\nSign up for the CEO Daily newsletter\nGet global perspectives and insights from CEOs on the biggest stories in business.\nThe U.S. economy is in chaos.

It is currently trading at more than $63,000 at the time of writing, representing an approximately 6% increase from yesterday's price.\nMoreover, the fourth quarter of this year is likely to bring accelerated inflows to bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Alice Liu, Lead Researcher at CoinMarketCap. Ethereum ETFs might also benefit from increased inflows, thanks to market dynamics bringing more capital into crypto and other risky assets, she added.\n“Historically, [the fourth quarter] has often been a strong period for bitcoin, with an average price increase of 90.33% over the past 10 years,” Liu said. “Notably, this year, we’re entering [the fourth quarter] from a relatively low price level. With these factors in mind, there’s a significant chance we could see a price surge during the remainder of the year, potentially even pushing bitcoin towards another all-time high.”\nBitcoin also has a favorable environment thanks to a reduction in liquidity. “A half a percent cut is a positive surprise, and represents an easing of liquidity conditions,” added Steven Lubka, Head of Swan Private at Swan Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is highly correlated to the liquidity environment, and this should support higher bitcoin prices into the end of the year and beyond.”\nOther analysts like Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, added that bitcoin was likely to move closer to its all-time high: \"This significant cut is seen as highly favorable for equity markets, providing a risk-on signal for traders in the short-term.”\n“However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, as this move could also be seen as an emergency measure, suggesting that the Fed may have delayed action and misjudged the optimal timing for easing,” Lienkha added. “Over the next three months, it will become clearer whether the Fed can guide the economy toward a soft landing and avoid a recession in this cycle.”"]}

This rate cut lowers borrowing costs, and its impact will be felt in three to six months. For businesses and consumers, it’s going to reduce the cost of loans and variable-rate debt, which is much needed after years of inflation.\"\nPackham also commented on the political timing of the rate cut. \"Some on the right are pointing fingers at the Fed, questioning their impartiality,\" he said. However, despite the controversy, he sees the decision as \"a very positive series of policy changes for bitcoin for sure.\"\nBitcoin's price rallied about 6% higher to close out the week after the Fed made its rate decision final Wednesday.\nRob Nelson pressed Packham on whether bitcoin’s price would experience a significant jump in the coming weeks. Packham attributed the current range-bound price to election uncertainties. \"One candidate is pro-crypto, while the other offers mixed signals. When prediction markets show a strong Kamala Harris lead, bitcoin tends to struggle. A Trump lead, however, often boosts bitcoin’s price,\" he explained.\nDespite short-term fluctuations, Packham remains optimistic about bitcoin’s long-term outlook. \"Bitcoin has a habit of surprising everyone,\" he said, adding that historical trends suggest a bullish movement next year, regardless of the election outcome.",null,"20th Sep, 2024. 04:48 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 1, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 17626553.54 on 20 September 2024.\n1 BTC = 17626553.54 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

But bitcoiners being bitcoiners, they think that prices can rise in either scenario.\nThe event is the US presidential election.\nI recently spoke to two of the prominent bitcoin faithful, Tom Lee of Fundstrat and Michael Novogratz of Galaxy Digital, at the Future Proof festival in California. Both see a path to the election as a win-win for bitcoin.\nFormer President Donald Trump has been an outspoken proponent of crypto. He’s pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who is perceived as a crypto foe by the industry. He has said that the US Treasury would retain any crypto seized from criminals, although he stopped short of saying the government would purchase bitcoin. He made a big splash speaking at the crypto industry’s biggest conference in late July.\nVice President Harris hasn’t staked out an official position on crypto, so many of the vocal crypto faithful have thrown their support behind Trump.\nLee said that some of bitcoin’s recent gains are linked to odds of a Trump win. On the flip side, “I don’t think bitcoin necessarily responds to Harris becoming president,” he said. “Bitcoin will then focus on a dovish bet because in an easing cycle, this is a big tailwind for risk assets, and that would be bullish for bitcoin.”\nNovogratz, a center-left Democrat, said Biden’s crypto approach was “painful.”\n“I think Kamala Harris will pivot,” he added. “I think she’s a practicalist.” As he said earlier in the conversation, “being anti-crypto is a little bit like being anti-dog. It's just not smart politics. And so I think the Democrats are getting there. But Trump got there first.”\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nStandard Chartered head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick is another believer.\n“I think we will go to fresh all-time highs by the end of this year, no matter what happens in the US election,” Kendrick told Yahoo Finance this week. “A Trump presidency should be more positive, given he's been relatively constructive on bitcoin.” His Bitcoin price prediction would rise to $125,000 by the end of 2024 if Trump won. Like his peers, no Trump? No problem. A Harris win could still mean bitcoin at $75,000 by year-end.\nSo, bitcoin goes up no matter what?

Bitcoin was trading near $63,000, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 8% over the week. Ether, meanwhile, was hovering around $2,600, with a 2.5% gain in the last 24 hours and an impressive 15% rise over the week, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThe surge follows a pivotal decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last Wednesday, when the Fed lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, setting the federal funds target range at 4.75% to 5.00%. This move had an immediate and positive effect on risk assets, with cryptocurrencies leading the charge. The overall crypto market followed suit, with altcoins including Solana (SOL), Dogecoin, and Cardano gaining 8.5%, 4.9%, and 5.9%, respectively, over the past week.\nHowever, it was the AI-driven token sector that saw the most dramatic growth. Tokens such as Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), Bittensor (TAO), and Sui (SUI) surged 25%, 81%, and 38% in a week, respectively, as investors poured in, eager to capitalize on the momentum sparked by the Fed’s rate cut.\nThe spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the spot Ether ETFs have been struggling since September. According to ETF tracker Farside, while spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced mixed inflows and outflows in September, spot Ether ETFs saw predominantly outflows. However, this trend may shift in the coming days following the Fed’s interest rate cut, potentially encouraging investors to allocate more funds to the crypto ETFs.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","23rd Sep, 2024. 04:56 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 6, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 17615408.33 on 23 September 2024.\n1 BTC = 17615408.33 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

I've never seen one quite like Ms. Ellison.\"\nStill, the judge said even extraordinary cooperation could not be a \"get out of jail free card.\"\nThe judge called out another distinction between Ellison and Bankman-Fried.\n\"You are genuinely remorseful,\" Kaplan said. \"He's sorry the gamble he took didn't work out and he's really sorry he got caught.\"\nBefore the judge handed down the sentence, Ellison stood at a podium and apologized.\n\"I want to apologize most of all to the victims,\" Ellison said, sniffling through tears. \"Not a day goes by when I don't think about all the people I hurt.\"\nEllison said she was \"deeply ashamed\" by her conduct that enabled what the defense conceded was an \"enormous and extraordinary fraud.\"\nIt exposed Ellison to 110 years in prison, but her attorney sought a sentence without prison time.\n\"She has recovered her moral compass,\" defense attorney Anjan Sahni said in court. \"Caroline Ellison is a good person who, at 29 years old, can still make a positive impact on the world.\"\nProsecutors agreed.\n\"Caroline Ellison deserves leniency,\" Assistant United States Attorney Danielle Sassoon said. \"A lenient sentence is also what is just.\"\nSassoon noted Ellison consistently told the truth and never shied from her own culpability.\n\"This was a powerful contrast with Bankman-Fried's testimony,\" Sassoon said.\nAhead of her sentencing, Ellison's attorneys urged Kaplan to be lenient, arguing Ellison \"unflinchingly acknowledged her own wrongdoing, without minimization, blame shifting or self-pity.\"\n\"She time and again proved herself an enormously credible and important cooperating witness\" against Bankman-Fried, they added.\nFederal prosecutors agreed Ellison provided \"extraordinary cooperation that was crucial to the Government's successful prosecution\" of Bankman-Fried.\n\"Although she did not blow the whistle on any misconduct before FTX's collapse, she came clean prior to FTX's declaring bankruptcy to her employees on November 9, 2022,\" Sassoon wrote in a letter to the judge. \"Ellison approached her cooperation with remarkable candor, remorse, and seriousness.\"\nProsecutors declined to make a specific sentencing recommendation in their filing. Defense attorneys suggested a sentence in line with a recommendation from probation officials of time served plus three years supervised release.\n\"Caroline poses no risk of recidivism and presents no threat to public safety. It would therefore promote respect for the law to grant leniency in recognition of Caroline's early disclosure of the crimes, her unmitigated acceptance of responsibility for them, and -- most importantly -- her extensive cooperation with the government,\" Sahni wrote in a letter to the judge.\nSahni outlined Ellison's \"complex\" relationship with Bankman-Fried that began when the two met at Jane Street Capital in 2015 when she was an intern and he was a junior trader. He said their \"on-again-off-again, sometimes-secret relationship\" had \"warped\" her moral compass and led her to take actions \"that she knew to be wrong, helping him steal billions.\"\nDuring Bankman-Fried's sentencing hearing in March, Judge Kaplan also ordered that he forfeit $11 billion that the government can use to compensate victims.\nThe former crypto billionaire has filed an appeal to overturn his conviction.\nTwo former FTX executives who also pleaded guilty in the case -- former director of engineering Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang -- are set to be sentenced in October and November, respectively.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe timing of future large-scale investments moving into the cryptocurrency market could propel price action in 2024.\nRoundtable anchor, Rob Nelson, recently discussed institutional adoption of crypto with David Gokhshtein, founder of Gokhshtein Media, and Sue Ennis, head of investor relations at Hut 8. The discussion covered key factors that could drive bitcoin's next price surge, including institutional capital, economic conditions, and geopolitical influences like the U.S. elections.\nRob Nelson emphasized the significant amount of capital waiting to enter the Bitcoin space, ranging from sovereign wealth funds to family offices and financial advisors. \"There’s a lot of money that’s going to start moving in,\" he stated, stressing that the timing of this deployment remains uncertain, but it is inevitable.\nDavid Gokhshtein agreed, predicting the deployment would happen soon. \"In the next month or two, you’ll see the charts start moving up again,\" he said, attributing the delay to institutions waiting for favorable conditions like rate cuts. He pointed to Wall Street players being prepared to make significant moves.\nNelson asked Gokhshtein where this capital would come from, to which he replied that major institutions like BlackRock are poised to invest heavily. “BlackRock, with their $9 trillion in assets, is going directly after Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Gokhshtein explained, adding that their moves will be on their own timeline.\nSue Ennis added that Bitcoin's deployment could be influenced by falling interest rates and the outcome of the U.S. elections.\nShe also mentioned the potential for bitcoin to capture 1-2% of gold’s market cap, which could drive significant price appreciation. \"That would give bitcoin very well north of a $100,000 price per coin,\" she noted, citing VanEck's predictions for bitcoin's role in global trade and reserve holdings by 2050.\nWealth advisors at major banks like Morgan Stanley had only recently been given the green light to start actively pitching Bitcoin ETFs to clients.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nIn a recent discovery, the U.S. government’s crypto strategy has been leaked, revealing critical insights into how major banks and regulators are preparing to handle digital assets. After a deep dive into hours of meetings and reports, the implications for Bitcoin holders are huge.\nThis report shines a light on the involvement of BNY Mellon, America’s oldest and largest custodian bank, which recently received SEC approval for crypto custody services. If you hold any crypto, this news is a game-changer. Here’s why the government’s strategy could send shockwaves through the industry, and why I’ve got a bold Bitcoin price prediction you won’t want to miss.\nBNY Mellon, founded in 1784, is the oldest and largest custodian bank in the U.S., and they’ve just received the green light from the SEC to offer crypto custody services. This is massive news for the entire crypto market because custodial services allow banks to securely hold and manage assets like Bitcoin for their clients.\nCustodial services are critical for the growth of institutional adoption, as they provide a secure way for large investors to hold cryptocurrencies. And when BNY Mellon—one of the most well-connected banks in the U.S.—gets involved, it signals a major shift in the crypto landscape.\nThe leaked details come from a Wyoming public hearing, where discussions around BNY Mellon’s involvement in crypto were unveiled. Here’s the key takeaway: BNY Mellon has received a variance from the SEC, allowing them to bypass Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which has been a roadblock for banks looking to offer crypto custody services.\nSAB 121 required banks to hold the same amount in cash reserves as the value of the cryptocurrency they were holding for clients—an enormous burden that kept many banks on the sidelines. However, BNY Mellon’s exemption from this rule signals a shift in regulatory attitudes, clearing the path for more traditional banks to enter the crypto space.\nThis isn’t just about one bank. The move by BNY Mellon could lead to a domino effect, with other large financial institutions entering the crypto custody game. Michael Saylor, one of the largest Bitcoin holders, has hinted that major U.S. banks are preparing to custody Bitcoin. And now, with BNY Mellon leading the charge, it seems the floodgates could soon open.\nOnce traditional banks begin offering crypto custody services, institutional demand for Bitcoin could skyrocket, driving prices higher as Bitcoin becomes more accessible to large investors.\nNow, let’s talk about what this could mean for Bitcoin’s price. Recent analysis shows Bitcoin is currently forming a W-pattern, a bullish indicator that could push prices to new highs. Based on technical analysis, Bitcoin could soon hit $67,000 as it nears the top of its current trading range.\nBut that’s not all—if the W-pattern completes as expected, Bitcoin could soar to an all-time high of $75,000. This pattern, combined with the growing involvement of major financial institutions like BNY Mellon, creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s next major rally.\nWith the U.S. government allowing banks like BNY Mellon to bypass restrictive regulations, the crypto market is on the brink of a major shift. Institutional adoption is accelerating, and Bitcoin’s price could soon reflect this new wave of demand.\nAs BNY Mellon and other banks enter the space, Bitcoin could be on track to hit $75,000, marking a new all-time high. If you’re holding Bitcoin or any other crypto, now is the time to pay attention to these developments—they could reshape the market in ways we’ve never seen before.","Date:\nShare post:\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is gaining attention with bullish predictions following its recent listing on eToro, sparking a 7% price increase and growing investor interest.

Ethereum is showing signs of forming a bottom against Bitcoin, igniting analysts' predictions for a possible uptrend. At the same time, Cardano is gearing up to reclaim its value.\nRecent data shows Ethereum (ETH) has been in a prolonged downtrend against Bitcoin but appears to be stabilizing around the $2,550 range.

China’s central bank has announced a major liquidity boost, and as cheap capital floods global markets, Bitcoin, a historically strong beneficiary of these trends, appears poised for exponential gains.

Furthermore, Kelly Kellam outlines China's potential plans to inject ¥1 trillion ($142 billion) into its largest banks will further drive liquidity into the global markets, setting the stage for a massive final parabolic bull trend wave to end sometime in Q3 2025.\nA critical technical factor supporting the bullish outlook is the continued compression of Bitcoin's volatility. Historically, periods of low volatility in Bitcoin have been followed by large price movements, often in the upward direction. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election, historical data suggests that post-election cycles tend to coincide with significant market activity, further bolstering the expectation of price appreciation. Coupled with the global liquidity cycle and Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle, all indicators point toward a continuation of the current market momentum, likely culminating in a bullish 2025.\nAs markets enter October (historically referred to as UPtober, investors are closely watching Bitcoin’s performance as the election fast approaches as well.

With the global liquidity injection in full swing and the 160-day mark approaching, the US Elections fast upon us, time is running out to get positioned before the next few months begin to melt to the upside.

Crypto has been embraced by retail for the longest period of time.\" He noted that institutions are \"only just starting to come in\" and represent \"a different category of investors,\" which could bring significant liquidity to the market.\nRegulatory clarity is another factor Teng believes will bolster the cryptocurrency landscape. As regulators \"start to embrace this space,\" it brings \"confidence to users\" and \"boosts sentiments,\" he said. This positive shift, along with funds being raised by various venture capital and private equity firms to invest in different areas of crypto, signals a promising future for the industry.\nRegarding bitcoin's halving cycles, Teng remained optimistic about future price trends. \"Every four years, supply will reduce, and what we see in past cycles is six to twelve months after bitcoin halving, prices normally go uptrend, sometimes a very sharp uptrend,\" he stated. \"I don't see anything that suggests otherwise. We do think that that's going to happen.\"","Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nFollow:\nThe stock market is racking up record highs again. Investors are wasting no time moving into riskier assets from bitcoin to tech stocks after last week’s long-awaited rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\nLast week, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to new highs after the Fed said it is cutting interest rates by half a point, marking a pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle that brought rates to a 23-year high.\nCNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is at a “greed” reading.\nStrong economic data this week has kept the party going. The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target.\nRelated article\nA dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more\nFresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year.\n“What seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession.\nElsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy.\nInvestors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July’s dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed’s focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday’s report will likely offer clues for the Fed’s next move at its November policy meeting.\nRelated article\nAmericans are fretting over the job market\nMeanwhile, tech shares continued to gain this week on rate cut optimism and strong earnings from Micron. Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%.\nIn China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates.\nOil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil.\nGold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy’s health.\nBitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin.\nAs stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.\nCNN’s Bryan Mena and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.","27th Sep, 2024. 03:37 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 6, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 18175177.08 on 27 September 2024.\n1 BTC = 18175177.08 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

In crypto stocks, Coinbase slid 6.8% and MicroStrategy fell 4.3%.\nFor the month, bitcoin finished its strongest September since 2012 with a 7.9% gain and its second positive September — historically the cryptocurrency's weakest month — in a row. It posted a quarterly gain of 2.8%.\nCoinbase finished the month down 2.8% and the quarter down 20%. Some analysts see that downtrend continuing in the coming weeks. It also posted back-to-back quarterly losses for the first time since the first half of 2022 and the worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy is up about 27% for the month and 22.5% for the quarter.\nAnalysts have warned about overbought conditions as bitcoin last week climbed nearly 5% in the five days ending Sept. 27, as net inflows into global crypto exchange-traded products accelerated to their highest level since mid-July. During the same period, Coinbase and MicroStrategy gained 12% and 21%, respectively.\nThe combined net buying volume of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week (16,774 BTC) exceeded a typical one-month supply of newly mined bitcoin (13,500), according to Bitwise-owned ETC Group. This was largely due to the policy reversal by the People's Bank of China, the firm said.\nOn Monday Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spooked investors in mid-afternoon trading, cautioning that although more rate cuts are coming, the central bank does not have a preset path. Investors are also bracing for strikes at ports up and down the East Coast and along the Gulf Coast after midnight Monday, which could shake the economy ahead of the holiday season, as well as ISM Manufacturing data Tuesday.\nThe market is heading into a seasonally strong quarter for crypto and risk assets broadly.\nBitcoin's narrative is often debated — whether it is a store of value or a risk asset — but its correlation is currently closer to that of the S&P 500 than to gold, and investors expect it to benefit from rate cuts, clarity following the U.S. presidential election and seasonal and favorable market conditions translating into greater flows into crypto ETFs.\n—CNBC's Nick Wells contributed reporting.","The cryptocurrency market is poised to enter the new quarter with renewed optimism, fueled by recent interest rate cuts and the anticipation surrounding the upcoming November election. Regardless of the outcome, both major political sides have hinted at policies that could be favorable to the crypto industry, further boosting investor confidence.\nWith this optimistic outlook, let’s take a closer look at the cryptocurrencies currently making waves in the cryptosphere.\n2 \/ 7\nThe biggest memecoin by market cap, Dogecoin, is experiencing a significant surge, driven by a combination of factors. Key among these is the recent interest rate cuts announced in September, which have injected fresh optimism into the broader cryptocurrency market. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.12, marking a substantial 13% increase over the past seven days. One expert has predicted an explosive rally for Dogecoin.\n3 \/ 7\nShiba Inu, Dogecoin’s main rival and another popular memecoin, has seen a significant surge in recent days. The primary driver behind this rally is the burn rate, which spiked by an impressive 640%, with approximately 1 million SHIB tokens burned in a single transaction, according to data from Shibburn. In total, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has removed 5.56 million SHIB tokens from circulation over the past 24 hours.\nFor those unfamiliar, coin burning is the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. The goal is to reduce the supply of tokens, which, in turn, can increase the value of the remaining coins.\nCurrently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001837, reflecting a 27% increase over the past week.\n4 \/ 7\nThe rapid growth of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has also propelled other memecoins, such as Pepe—a frog-themed cryptocurrency that now ranks among the top 30 by market capitalization. Riding the wave of bullish market sentiment, Pepe has surged over 36% in the past week and is currently trading at $0.00001096.\n5 \/ 7\nSolana, a major competitor to Ethereum and home to hundreds of decentralized apps, has seen recent growth, driven by a bullish report from VanEck. The report predicts that Solana could reach $330, potentially capturing 50% of Ethereum’s current market capitalization. VanEck highlights Solana’s superior transaction speed—processing over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum’s 15-45 TPS—as a key factor behind its strong outlook. This speed advantage makes Solana especially attractive for high-volume transactions, such as payments and remittances.\nCurrently, Solana is trading at $155, reflecting an 8% increase over the past week.\n6 \/ 7\nXRP has been surging in response to a new project from Ripple, the blockchain technology company behind the cryptocurrency. Ripple is preparing to launch a stablecoin called RLUSD, which will be pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. The stablecoin will be fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, recently suggested that the official launch of RLUSD could happen before the end of 2024.\nCurrently, XRP is trading at $0.47, showing an 8% increase over the past week.\n7 \/ 7","Date:\nShare post:\nBNB and Polkadot, despite their big roles in the market, face rising price pressures.
