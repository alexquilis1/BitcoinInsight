Securities Commission panel has issued an $18.4-million penalty against a person who used his cryptocurrency trading platform to defraud investors.\nDavid Smillie and his numbered company 1081627 B.C. Ltd. — operating as ezBtc — were ordered by the commission on Nov. 27 to repay $10.4 million of ill-gotten gains and an $8-million administrative fine.\nSmillie was found to have taken upwards of $13 million worth of assets from his clients to use for personal expenses or to gamble online.\nInvestors also lost out on what, so far, in retrospect, was a significant missed opportunity with the rise of bitcoin’s value.\nSmillie was the directing mind of ezBtc, which was incorporated in 2016.\nSmillie first solicited people to deposit their bitcoin and ether cryptocurrency in his accounts (or crypto “wallets”), via the ezBtc website, in order to further trade the assets.\nSmillie offered what he described as a “unique savings program that allows customers to safely earn a 9% commission annually with daily payments,” although ezBtc charged fees for deposits, withdrawals and trades, according to the panel’s liability findings on Aug. 7.\nBetween 2016 and 2019, customers deposited over 2,300 bitcoins and over 600 ethers into their ezBtc addresses on the platform.\nAn investigation order was issued in 2019, following complaints to the commission.\nFour ezBtc customers who had been defrauded testified at a commission hearing last April.\nFor example, a customer identified as “JJ” asked for a $73,000 withdrawal but was initially denied, in April 2017.\nWhen JJ tried to transfer his remaining bitcoin, Smillie told him that the ezBtc’s website had been hacked and that approximately 484 of JJ’s bitcoin had been stolen.\nSmillie eventually wrote JJ a cheque for $73,000 in person, in Vancouver, in May 2021. However, JJ never recovered the 484 bitcoins.\nSmilie “made excuses about non-payments and threatened customers who complained publicly,” the panel stated.\nSmillie ended up depositing much of the cryptocurrency into his personal accounts and online gambling sites. The daily balance of ezBtc’s bitcoin and ethereum wallets never exceeded 11 bitcoins and 20 ethers, respectively, the commission found.\nSmillie and ezBtc “fraudulently diverted their customers’ crypto assets for their own purposes,” the panel concluded.\n“Their deceit was blatant and repeated,” the panel stated, adding that “Smillie blatantly and repeatedly lied to customers as he authorized, permitted or acquiesced in the transfers of bitcoin and ether to his personal accounts and online gambling sites.\n“It is obvious that Smillie ought to have known that transferring customers’ assets to his personal accounts and to online gambling sites, instead of keeping them at ezBtc in cold storage, could result in the loss of those assets and put the customers’ pecuniary interest at risk.”\nThe panel issued its penalty based on the value of the unrecovered cryptocurrency in July 2019.\nThe commission calculated 935 bitcoins and 159 ethers were then worth about $13 million although by last April it was worth about $94 million. (Since November, bitcoin has risen in value about 30 per cent compared to April.)\nSmillie did not attend the hearings in person or by videoconference, but he was represented by legal counsel Cody Reedman.\n“We have no evidence of Smillie’s personal circumstances or his ability to pay,” and Reedman’s statement at the time of the hearing last April that Smillie was “impecunious” was not supported by any evidence, the panel stated.\nIn addition to the fines, the panel permanently banned Smillie from participating in B.C.’s investment market, except as an investor through a registered advisor. ezBtc is likewise permanently prohibited from trading its shares or engaging in any promotional activity, the commission stated Monday.\nThe findings against Smillie are administrative and not civil nor criminal.\nThe commission has the ability to recommend criminal charges to the BC Prosecution Service, at its discretion. It may also forward a file to the RCMP’s Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET).\nGlacier Media asked if it had done so.\n“Section 11 of the BC Securities Act requires us to keep all information confidential unless our public duty requires us to disclose information like during public enforcement actions or legal proceedings. As a result, we are unable to confirm or deny whether we have forwarded this matter to IMET or recommended criminal charges,” stated spokesperson Elise Palmer.\nThe RCMP IMET did not respond to Glacier Media, which will update this article with any response, should it.\nCrypto trading platforms that sell “futures contracts\" whose value is derived from an underlying cryptocurrency asset — such as those that ezBtc entered into with customers — are subject to securities laws in Canada.\nA list of crypto trading platforms authorized to do business with Canadians is available on the website of the Canadian Securities Administrators, of which the B.C.

The 29th UN Climate Change Conference-COP29 began earlier this week in Azerbaijan, focusing on global warming and other critical environmental issues. Meanwhile, India's retail inflation surpassed the upper limit of the central bank’s aim in October.\nClimate fundingThe COP29 began this week in Azerbaijan, focusing on securing financial support for developing countries grappling with climate damage. A key agenda is updating the $100 billion annual commitment made in 2015 by developed nations. The new “collective quantified goal\" (NCQG), due by 2025, will better align with the needs of developing nations, Mint reported. The UN’s Adaptation Gap Report shows international public adaptation finance grew from $22 billion in 2021 to $28 billion in 2022, but the need is 18 times higher, and even if funding hits $40 billion by 2025, it would only cover 5% of the need. \n\n\n\nPinching pricesAt 6.21%, retail inflation in October breached the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI's) target for the first time since August 2023. Food inflation spiked to 10.87%, up from 9.24% in September, with vegetable prices climbing 42.18%, the highest in nearly five years. Edible oils also saw a significant price increase, partly due to higher import duties. With October inflation surging, the RBI’s forecast of 4.8% for October-December will likely be breached unless inflation averages just 4.1% in November and December. \n\n\n\nEnergy boost$10 billion: This is the value of investments the Adani Group plans to make in energy and infrastructure projects in the US, the company's founder and chairman, Gautam Adani, announced in a social media post. Adani emphasized the group's goal to strengthen US-India ties by investing in American energy security and infrastructure while also creating up to 15,000 jobs. The Adani Group has businesses in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Australia, among other nations, mainly in the mining, power, and ports sectors.\n\nCurrency strainThe Indian rupee has continuously weakened this week, mainly due to a stronger US dollar and continued outflows from the stock markets. The rupee weakened to 84.39 per dollar on 13 November from 84.08 at the beginning of the month. According to Reuters, the decline in the rupee may have been due to foreign investors selling nearly $3 billion in November so far, adding to over $10 billion in outflows seen in October. Despite this, the central bank's regular interventions have kept the rupee's decline steady and avoided sharp volatility. \n\n\n\nTech shake-upNvidia Corp., the world’s leading AI chipmaker, recently replaced Intel Corp., renowned for its computer processors, in the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nvidia's market value soared from $81 billion in 2018 to $3.6 trillion, surpassing Apple, Microsoft, and Google. In contrast, Intel’s market value dropped from $212 billion to $113 billion. The shift reflects the profound changes in the tech sector over the past few years, with AI taking centre stage and reshaping the fortunes of leading companies, showed an analysis by howindialives.com. \n\n\n\nCrypto craze$90,000: This is the level Bitcoin crossed on Wednesday amid rising expectations that US President-elect Donald Trump would fuel growth in cryptocurrencies. Before the election, it hovered around $68,000, and it has marked an over 30% rise since then. The rally is fueled by stock market optimism about Trump’s victory in the election and his campaign promises to make the US the crypto capital and create a national Bitcoin stockpile. This is contrary to the crackdown stance taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under former president Joe Biden.\n\nFDI trendsForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of Indian equities in October, raising concerns about the end of India’s stock market rally. While FPIs are volatile in nature, foreign direct investment (FDI), a more stable form of investment, is also facing challenges. Five of the six leading sectors saw lower FDI in FY24, an analysis by howindialives.com showed. FDI inflows into the manufacturing sector marked a decline in 2023-24 from the previous two years. Similar trends can be seen in computer services, communication services and retail and wholesale trade. \n\n\n\nChart of the week: Patent boomIndia has secured a place among the top 10 countries globally for patent, trademark, and industrial design applications, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 2024 report.

Its current CEO is Brad Garlinghouse.\nInterestingly, Ripple does not own XRP â which is an open source\ncryptocurrency.\nXRP was founded by David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto.\nThe idea behind XRP was to find a solution to the intrinsic limitations of\nBitcoin.\nThe XRP Ledger was launched in 2012 and the XRP token created shortly afterwards.\nXRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens.\nIt is more cost-effective, has faster transaction times, and is less energy-intensive than Bitcoin, as per the website, as per Investopedia.\nThe price of XRP has been shooting up since Trumpâs victory on November 5.\nAccording to Forbes, XRP leapfrogged Solanaâs SOL to become the worldâs fourth-largest cryptocurrency.\nIt has since passed Tether to become the worldâs third-largest cryptocurrency.\nBloomberg quoted Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, as saying that the price increase occurred after people overseas, particularly In South Korea, bought XRP in droves.\nChin said around $60 million in XRP short positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours.\nThatâs more than short liquidations for Bitcoin and Ether taken together.\nâThe move seems to be entirely retail driven as nothing has fundamentally changed for XRP itself,â Chin said. âThe move looks to be excessive given XRP is now a top-three digital asset, but that doesnât mean that it canât continue given the reflexivity in this market.â\nThe development also came after Fox Business reported that the New Yorkâs top crypto regulator, in a boost for Ripple, may approve the launch of its stablecoin in the state.\nRipple had launched a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in October â a year after winning a landmark case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which stated that it did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges.\nThe ruling stated that the token sold by Ripple Labs on public exchanges did not meet the legal definition of a security and the sales of the token were thus not subject to investor protection laws that the SEC enforces.\nStablecoins are digital tokens designed to keep a constant value. They are backed by traditional currencies such as the US dollar or euro.\nThey can be more suitable for payments and for converting crypto tokens into traditional currencies as they are shielded from the wild price fluctuations seen in Bitcoin and Ether.\nCrypto, on a whole, has been on an absolute tear since Trumpâs election victory.\nThe market has gained $1.2 trillion in value since November 5, data from CoinGecko shows.\nBitcoin last month for the first time traded near $100,000, while Ether, the worldâs second largest token, was at $3,613.\nBitcoin has market cap of nearly $1.89 trillion, while Ether has a market cap of around $436 billion.\nWith inputs from agencies","03rd Dec, 2024. 03:46 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 8, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 26567366.72 on 3 Dec 2024.\n1 BTC = 26567366.72 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.”\nThe comments come as Donald Trump’s incoming administration is expected to take steps to legitimize digital assets. On the campaign trail, Trump positioned himself as the “crypto candidate,” accepting campaign donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana.\nAt the Bitcoin conference in July, then-candidate Trump vowed to set up a national Bitcoin reserve, reaffirming his stance that the U.S. must emerge as a crypto capital and superpower in the world or face competition from other economic powers, like China.\nAfter his election win last month, Bitcoin surged to record high after record high, surpassing $98,000 before moderating. The leading cryptocurrency traded at around $96,800 as of Wednesday afternoon, with some crypto observers still hopeful that it could cross the $100,000 milestone before year’s end.\nWith a market capitalization of $1.92 trillion, Bitcoin surpassed silver as the eighth most valuable asset in the world with a market value of $1.75 trillion. It’s still far and away from gold, which is valued at nearly $18 trillion.\nWhen asked whether Powell would own crypto, the Fed chair said simply: “Not allowed to.”\nPowell did not address whether the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s decision-making arm, would carry out a third consecutive interest rate cut following its Dec. 17 and 18 meeting. He noted, however, that inflation is slightly hotter than the central bank expected.\n“Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher,” Powell said. “The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral.”\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, rose 2.3% year-over-year and 0.2% on a monthly basis in October. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, rose 2.8%. While inflation has largely continued to move towards the Fed’s 2% target, other central bank officials have expressed concern over the timing of their goals.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said Monday that while he is “leaning toward” a December rate cut, he is worried that progress on inflation may be “stalling.”\n“Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute,” he said in prepared remarks at the American Institute for Economic Research Monetary Conference.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.\nBitcoin traded above $100,000 for the first time, powered by a wave of investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump will turn U.S. government policy into an engine of growth for crypto.\nThe world’s largest digital currency has staged an extraordinary rally since Election Day, surging more than 40% in just four weeks and setting one record after another. During the campaign, Trump dropped his earlier skepticism of bitcoin and promised to “end Joe Biden’s war on crypto.\"\nIn return, crypto has embraced the new U.S. administration—a striking reversal from its early years as a cypherpunk rebellion against the establishment. No longer an outsider to political power, crypto is newly ascendant in Washington. Its march toward the mainstream has enriched a youthful cohort of digital-currency tycoons and swelled the value of the asset class to more than $3 trillion.\n“I find it very ironic,\" said Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at Clearmatics, a London-based blockchain company. “The whole purpose of bitcoin was to create an alternative payment infrastructure outside of traditional finance and government surveillance. Now some bitcoiners are looking to embrace governments, or even get subsidies.\"\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, proposed it in 2008 as a way to make payments without relying on the traditional banking system. Many of bitcoin’s early fans were libertarians who saw it as a way to let individuals control their financial destinies, free from the oversight of nosy banks and governments.\nNow, crypto investors are cheering Trump’s pledge to create a strategic national reserve for the government’s bitcoin holdings—a policy that could boost the price of the digital currency by absorbing supply. Trump has promised to ease the regulatory burden on the crypto industry. One of its main foes, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, plans to resign on Inauguration Day. Trump had vowed to fire Gensler, who has warned that digital currencies are rife with fraud and manipulation.\nGovernments in Bhutan and El Salvador have also amassed stashes of bitcoin. So have some publicly traded companies, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. Since bitcoin’s supply is limited—its algorithms impose a hard cap of 21 million coins, expected to be reached in around 2140—the emergence of large hoards locking up available supply is bullish for bitcoin’s price.\nWhatever policies Trump ends up implementing, his tone is a departure for the incoming leader of the U.S. government. Officials in Washington have long viewed crypto warily, associating it with illicit activity and investment scams.\nCongress is also more likely to pass legislation welcomed by the crypto industry, after crypto firms launched a wave of campaign spending to support friendly candidates and oust their critics. The effort helped topple lawmakers seen as hostile to the industry, such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio). In total, voters elected 298 pro-crypto representatives and senators, compared with 134 who are anti-crypto, according to a tally and ratings by Stand With Crypto, an advocacy group backed by Coinbase Global.\nBitcoin is practically never used today as a way to make payments—the original use envisioned by Nakamoto. Instead, proponents argue it is a form of “digital gold,\" a way to store monetary value and hedge against inflation.\nThere is no guarantee that bitcoin, with its history of wild volatility, will retain its current high price level. Bitcoin has repeatedly hit records on signs of mainstream adoption, before collapsing. In 2017, the year when bitcoin first began to draw broad attention, it spiked to nearly $20,000 after Chicago exchanges listed futures contracts on bitcoin.\nIn 2021, bitcoin hit a record of almost $69,000 following the launch of exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin futures. From that peak, it plunged 78% to less than $16,000 after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.\nBitcoin broke through into record territory again in March of this year, after the launch of “spot\" ETFs that hold bitcoin itself. Such funds have been a popular way for investors to play the recent Trump-fueled rally. Since Election Day, they have poured more than $7 billion into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, according to Morningstar Direct. The inflows have helped drive bitcoin higher.\nHolding bitcoin through ETFs is yet another departure from the origins of crypto. Early bitcoin holders could only access their coins and use them in transactions by typing in cryptographic keys—long strings of letters and numbers. After the rise of exchanges such as Coinbase, which held people’s bitcoin and provided an easy-to-use interface, some hardcore crypto fans scoffed at their users with the expression “not your keys, not your coins.\"\nWith spot bitcoin ETFs, investors are effectively letting Wall Street hold coins on their behalf, in exchange for the convenience of using the same traditional brokerage accounts they use to trade stocks and bonds. And many bitcoin proponents are comfortable with that.\n“People will tend to follow the path of least resistance and greatest familiarity to investing in and holding bitcoin, which means utilizing these traditional vehicles,\" said Josiah Hernandez, founder and chief executive of Satoshi Capital Advisors. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t have a significant negative effect on the underlying investment thesis of bitcoin for most people…that bitcoin is digital gold.\"\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Atkins, known for his advocacy of cryptocurrency, is currently the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner.\nTrump hailed Atkins as a 'proven leader for common sense regulations' and emphasized his belief in robust, innovative capital markets that prioritize investor needs and contribute to a thriving economy. Trump noted that Atkins acknowledges the importance of digital assets in enhancing America's economic status.\nIf the Senate confirms Atkins next year, he will replace current SEC chair Gary Gensler, who has faced criticism for introducing what some consider overly protective measures for investors. Gensler's leadership has highlighted tension between advocacy for investor protections and industry-led innovation.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - In a significant regulatory shift, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has announced Paul Atkins as his nomination to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A traditional conservative and Washington insider, Atkins brings with him a wealth of experience, having served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush.\nAtkins will replace the outgoing chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure was marked by a vigorous regulatory approach that often put him at odds with Wall Street and the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Gensler, known for enforcing over 40 rules to enhance transparency and mitigate risks, also initiated multiple lawsuits against crypto firms for alleged regulatory violations.\nAtkins is anticipated to adopt a more lenient stance on cryptocurrency regulation than his predecessor. His selection has been positively received by industry executives, who view him as a crypto-friendly advocate. In addition to his leadership at Patomak Global Partners, Atkins has actively participated in shaping digital asset policies as co-chair of the Token Alliance and as an advisory board member of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","Oops, something went wrong\nXRP is on a record-breaking rally, cementing its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nXRP’s market cap has soared to $150.18 billion, surpassing ride-hailing giant Uber at $150.07 billion and financial services leader Charles Schwab International at $148.49 billion.\nThis places XRP ahead of major companies like pharmaceutical giant Pfizer ($144.85 billion), banking leader Citigroup ($136.25 billion), and energy corporation ConocoPhillips ($137.18 billion), according to Stock Analysis, which ranks XRP 68th among S&P 500 stocks.\nOn Dec. 3, XRP's market capitalization briefly surpassed that of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which holds $158 billion in market capitalization.\nXRP also leads its closest crypto competitors, stablecoin Tether ($135.1 billion) and Layer 1 blockchain Solana ($112 billion).\n“XRP has flipped SOL in market cap. This was definitely not on my bingo card, but it shows how markets can sometimes react in totally unexpected ways,” wrote analysts from the Alpha Please newsletter. “The XRP army has shown us that they are stronger than we thought.”\nXRP’s rally has been fueled by massive investor optimism, gaining 420% in the past 30 days. On Dec. 4, the token hit an intraday high of $2.64, up from $0.50 on Nov. 5. The all-time high for XRP was $3.40, recorded on Jan. 7, 2018. Comparatively, the current price is 22.68% lower.\nA key factor behind XRP’s meteoric rise is Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump has pledged to make America the global hub for crypto by creating a friendlier regulatory environment, including firing Securities and Exchange Commissioner (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler.\nUnder Gensler’s leadership, the SEC cracked down on the crypto industry, filing lawsuits against major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, claiming it raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP.\nRipple contested the claim, arguing XRP functions as a digital currency, not a security. In a landmark July 2023 ruling, Judge Analisa Torres decided Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges were not securities transactions. However, she ruled institutional XRP sales were securities offerings, prompting the SEC to appeal in October 2024.\nThe resignation of Gensler in November and Trump’s pro-crypto stance have fueled hopes in the crypto industry that Ripple Labs may see regulatory relief under the new administration.\nRipple Labs is also garnering attention amid plans to launch a stablecoin, RLUSD.\nAccording to Fox Business, the New York Department of Financial Services is reviewing RLUSD for approval. If approved, Ripple could launch the stablecoin, potentially expanding XRP’s ecosystem.\nWith a $150 billion market cap, XRP now trails only Bitcoin and Ethereum among cryptocurrencies. Much of its momentum comes from whale activity, as large XRP holders drive trading dynamics.\nPseudonymous analyst Woominkyu noted that spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions often coincide with price peaks. Recent data showed whales transferring XRP to Binance as the token hit $2.30, signaling potential profit-taking.\n“Whales tend to move large amounts of XRP to exchanges near local or cycle tops,” said Woominkyu. “This could indicate whales preparing for potential profit-taking or increased market activity.”\nKi Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytical firm, added, “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge.”\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt described XRP’s breakout as a “massive coil,” predicting strong bullish potential into 2025.\nMeanwhile, Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, called XRP’s chart “good-looking” and placed it in the “banana zone,” indicating it is primed for a price rally.","Rexas Finance is making a significant impact in the cryptocurrency sector with its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization.

The S&P 500 has increased about 2.4% over that period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped 2.6%.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nTrump said he would replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom many crypto proponents dislike for what they perceive as a robust approach to crypto regulation.\nGensler announced that he plans to resign on Jan. 20, 2025, the date of Trump's inauguration.\nThe post-election euphoria has lifted other parts of the crypto sector. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has climbed 27%. Lesser-known dogecoin has skyrocketed about 140%, while litecoin has surged 35%.\nShares of Coinbase, a top crypto trading platform, have increased more than 70% since Trump's reelection.\nThe growth in recent weeks extends a remarkable turnabout for the once-beleaguered crypto industry. The sector entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.\nFTX, a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed in November 2022. The implosion set off a 17-month legal saga that resulted in the conviction of Bankman-Fried for fraud. In April, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\nChangpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in April after pleading guilty to charges that his platform had enabled illicit financial activity.\nThe reelection of Trump marks the latest in a series of positive developments that have buoyed cryptocurrency this year.\nThose gains have been propelled, in part, by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.\nLast month, options on BlackRock's popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were made available for trading on the Nasdaq. The options, which provide a new avenue for bitcoin investors, allow individuals to commit to buy or sell the ETF at a given price by a specific date. While such investments typically come with additional risk, they can also make large payouts.\nIBIT inched upward 1% on Friday, reaching a record high of about $56.\nBryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, attributed the recent crypto surge to investors' anticipation of friendly policy under Trump, as well as the newly available options trading for bitcoin ETFs.\nStill, the performance of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, has proven volatile, Armour added. The price of bitcoin could fall, especially if Trump encounters difficulty following through on his campaign commitments, he said.\n\"As long as the narrative stays positive, there's always room to grow,\" Armour told ABC News before bitcoin reached $100,000. \"I also think campaign promises don't always come to fruition.\"\n\"It's still a highly volatile asset,\" Armour added.","BREAKING: Court of International Trade rules several of Trump's tariffs 'invalid'\nThe price of bitcoin soared past the long-awaited $100,000 benchmark for the first time ever late Wednesday evening.\nBy Thursday afternoon, the flagship cryptocurrency pulled back from the milestone. It was recently higher by 0.28% at $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics, trading at the lows of Thursday’s trading following some profit taking by investors. On Wednesday night, it rose as high as $103,844.05.\nThe move came after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment could fulfill Trump’s most important campaign promise to the crypto industry: to replace Gary Gensler, who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership.\nTrump congratulated bitcoiners in a Truth Social post Thursday morning, saying “you’re welcome” for his part in helping send bitcoin to $100,000 and that “together, we will make America great again.”\nIt’s a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or “HODL’d” through several of the cryptocurrency’s boom-and-bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class.\nThat’s largely because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-establishment roots. The original idea for bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper.\nIn recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin’s “IPO” moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration.\nOn Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is “just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that “people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value” and that “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.”\n“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC.\nBitcoin had been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22.\nThere is much hope that Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead — including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs.\n“Over the long term, I’m bullish,” Novogratz added. “It won’t be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.”\nBitcoin is now up more than 133% in 2024 and 42% since the election.\nTanaya Macheel is a cryptocurrency and financial technology reporter for CNBC.","Oops, something went wrong\nUS stocks drifted lower on Thursday as investors waited for Friday's crucial jobs report and bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid after reaching a new high of over $103,000.\nAll three major averages were lower on Thursday after closing at records the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was also off about 0.2%.\nInvestors are counting down to Friday's monthly jobs report for a reality check on Jerome Powell's upbeat take on the strength of the US economy. While the Federal Reserve Chair said that means policymakers can move cautiously, he stopped short of challenging the market's belief in a December rate cut.\nTraders have slightly pared their bets on easing, pricing in a 74% chance the Fed will cut by 25 basis points on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch tool. That compares to around 77% on Wednesday and 67% a week ago.\nA strong print in November's nonfarm payrolls report on Friday could upend those bets. On Thursday, fresh data from the Department of Labor showed 224,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 30, up from 215,000 the week prior. The previous reading had been the lowest total of weekly claims since April.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose to around $103,000 after breaking through the key $100,000 level late on Wednesday, before reversing course and trading around $99,000. The token's surge past the key level came after President-elect Trump picked Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAfter a calm day for stocks on Thursday, the November jobs report is set to highlight the final trading day of the week.\nThe report is expected to show hiring rebounded last month after hurricanes and a strike by Boeing (BA) workers weighed heavily on the October report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is projected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 215,000 in November while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nIn October, the US economy added just 12,000 jobs amid various disruptions to economic activity while the unemployment rate stood at 4.1% for a second straight month.\nRead the full preview here.\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) stock rose about 9% in after-hours trading as the company's third quarter earnings per share of $5.14 handily topped Wall Street's forecast for $4.53.\nMeanwhile, Ulta's third quarter revenue was a narrower beat, with sales for the quarter hitting $2.53 billion, above the $2.5 billion analysts had projected.\nLululemon (LULU) stock rose as much as 7% in after-hours trading before paring back gains after the company reported better-than-expected third quarter results.\nHere's how Lululemon performed compared to Wall Street's expectations, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\nFor the full year, Lululemon forecasted net revenue in a range of $10.45 billion to $10.49 billion. Analysts had been expecting $10.42 billion. Meanwhile, the retailer said it expects earnings per share in a range of $14.08 to $14.16, meeting the high end of Wall Street's forecasts.\nRead more here.\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied more than 3% on Thursday on the back of bullish commentary from Bank of America Securities lead analyst John Murphy.\n“The trip gave us increased confidence that TSLA is well-positioned to grow in 2025+ with its core EV business and launch of its robotaxi offering, and longer-term from its investments in Optimus,” Murphy wrote in a note to investors.\nMurphy reiterated his Buy rating for Tesla and upped his price target to $400 from $350.\nRead more here.\nYahoo Finance's Ben Werkschul reports from Washington:\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy received a rapturous welcome to Capitol Hill Thursday as questions piled up about exactly what the goals are for their extra-governmental \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE).\nMusk wasn’t overly interested in clarifying as he moved between meetings on Capitol Hill Thursday.\nAt one point, as he passed, a reporter shouted out “What’s DOGE?” The world's richest man didn't stop and only offered a chuckle in response.\nRead more here.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) eclipsed $100,000 per coin for the first time ever on Wednesday night, sparking a rally across the cryptocurrency.\nThe latest move higher in bitcoin came after President-elect Donald Trump picked Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins has been seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position.\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is now up more than 40% since the election. But an even more aggressive rally has been taking place in other crypto tokens. Ethereum (ETH-USD) is up almost 60% while smaller tokens like Ripple (XRP-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) have rallied triple digits.\nCoinDesk Indices head of product Andrew Baehr told Yahoo Finance the larger move in the smaller cryptocurrencies is likely because they have more regulatory hurdles to cross than bitcoin, which already has ETFs attached to it.\n\"The other assets count more on regulatory pavement,\" Baehr said. \"Think about things like smart contracts, stablecoins, future of finance, Web3, things that will change our lives in the future: They need the regulatory pavement.\"\nBaehr added that for regular investors looking for a small amount of crypto exposure in the broad portfolios, that doesn't mean buying into the risk-on rally in smaller coins is the way to go.\n\"You really have to be in the weeds to track [the smaller coins],\" Baehr said. \"And timing is almost impossible.\"\nShares of both Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) were under pressure on Thursday after Waymo, an upstart self-driving rideshare company, announced plans to expand to Miami.\nWaymo said it expects to have its rides available to all customers in Miami by 2026. Waymo, seen as a competitor to the two ridesharing giants, already provides over 150,000 trips per week across Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin, per a press release.\nUber and Lyft shares were both down about 10%.\nSince Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, various trades have had fits and starts as the president-elect names Cabinet members and discusses potential economic policies.\nFor instance, small caps took off right after Trump's win before cooling off and then eventually reaching record highs. The same could be said for a vaccine stock like Moderna (MRNA). Shares tanked when Trump nominated known anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services, but are now back near the same levels they were trading at before the nomination.\nThese jerky stock moves are just one example of how market participants remain uncertain on the difference between what Trump says will happen and what will actually happen.\n\"There will be traders that will try to play every sentence, every move, and I think that's kind of a loser's game because he can change his mind,\" AlTi Tiedemann Global chief investment officer Nancy Curtin told Yahoo Finance. \"In concept, he'll do what he said he would do. But the actual implementation remains to be seen.\"\nCurtin's advice for longer-term investors is to stay focused on the current trends that are more likely to definitely be intact in 2025.\n\"We think the fundamentals look pretty good,\" said Curtin, who noted she's optimistic about US equities in 2025. \"Earnings look pretty good. And by the way, a little animal spirits, M&A, IPOs, would also enhance trajectory.\"\nMeme stocks AMC (AMC) and Gamestop (GME) each popped more than 5% on Thursday afternoon after the X account linked to investor Keith Gill, also known as \"Roaring Kitty,\" posted for the first time since early September.\nThe account posted a picture of what appeared to be a fake Time Magazine cover with no clear reference to any individual stock.\nBack in May, Gill started a meme stock revival as he returned to his popular YouTube stream for the first time since the frenzy of 2021. The rally reversed as Gamestop issued more stock and Gill's accounts have been largely quiet since.\nBut GameStop shares have quietly picked up steam again in the past month, rising nearly 30%.\nQuarterly results from Lululemon (LULU) are expected to be a highlight after the bell on Thursday.\nWith shares down more than 30% this year, analysts are looking for signs of a rebound for the popular retailer.\nHere's what Wall Street expects from the report, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\nYahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the full preview here.\nYahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports:\nMortgage rates dropped again this week, spurring more potential homebuyers to submit applications as the 2024 buying season wanes.\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate fell to 6.69% from 6.81% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. Fifteen-year mortgage rates dropped to an average of 5.96% from 6.1% last week.\n“Despite just a modest drop in rates, consumers clearly have responded as purchase demand has noticeably improved,\" Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. \"The responsiveness of prospective homebuyers to even small changes in rates illustrates that affordability headwinds persist.”\nMortgage applications for home purchases rose 6% in the week through Friday, marking the fourth straight week of gains, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).

This view has been a common refrain from Wall Street firms offering bullish outlooks for 2025 over the last month.\n\"Earnings is almost everything when it comes to longer-term equity returns,\" Li said, adding the strongest revisions for next year have come from the US and Japan, where BlackRock is also overweight equities.\nRead more here.\nDisney (DIS) increased its cash dividend by 33% to $1.00 a share late Wednesday, a sign of confidence from the company after its streaming business built on recent momentum and swung to a profit in its latest quarterly report.\nThe dividend will be paid in two installments of $0.50 a share on Jan. 16 and July 23, 2025, to shareholders of record as of Dec. 16, 2024, and June 24, 2025, respectively.\n\"It’s been a highly successful year for The Walt Disney Company, stemming from the extensive strategic work across the company to improve quality, innovation, efficiency, and value creation,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a press release.\n\"With the company operating from a renewed position of strength, we are pleased to increase the dividend for shareholders while continuing to invest for the future and drive sustained growth through Disney’s world-class portfolio of assets.\"\nDisney shares have climbed about 29% since the start of the year, slightly outpacing the 27% gain of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) over that same time period.\nIt's the milestone crypto enthusiasts have been waiting for: Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices have officially crossed $100,000 a token.

It’s climbed dramatically since Election Day on hopes President-elect Donald Trump will be more friendly to crypto. Airline stocks were strong, while Treasury yields held relatively steady in the bond market.\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting around their records Thursday in the runup to a big jobs report due on Friday. The crypto market had much more action, and bitcoin briefly burst to a record above $103,000 before pulling back.\nThe S&P 500 was edging down by 0.1% after setting an all-time high for the 56th time this year the day before to improve one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 183 points, or 0.4%, with roughly an hour remaining in trading, while the Nasdaq composite was nearly unchanged from its own record set the day before.\nBitcoin powered above $100,000 the night before, after President-elect Donald Trump chose a crypto advocate, Paul Atkins, as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it quickly fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk.\nSharps swings for bitcoin are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride. After rising as much as 9% in early trading, MicroStrategy, a company that’s been raising cash just to buy bitcoin, swung to a loss of 5.9%. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global fell 3.2% after likewise erasing a big early gain.\nElsewhere on Wall Street, stocks of airlines helped lead the way following the latest bumps up to financial forecasts from carriers.\nAmerican Airlines Group soared 18.6% after saying it’s making more in revenue during the last three months of 2024 than it expected, and it will likely make a bigger profit than it had earlier forecast. The airline also chose Citi to be its exclusive partner for credit cards that give miles in its loyalty program. That should help its cash coming in from co-branded credit card and other partners grow by about 10% annually.\nSouthwest Airlines climbed 3.4% after saying it’s seeing stronger demand from leisure travelers than it expected. It also raised its forecast for revenue for the holiday traveling season.\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was Synposys, which tumbled 12.1%. The supplier for the semiconductor industry reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it also warned of “continued macro uncertainties” and gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters fell even more, 15.3%, after the retailer said it’s preparing for “potential choppiness” outside of peak selling periods. It was reminiscent of a warning from Foot Locker earlier in the week and raised more concerns about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain.\nSolid spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has avoided a recession  that earlier seemed inevitable  after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market.\nThis week’s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels.\nExpectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate  from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.18%, where it was late Wednesday.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly calm in Europe after far-right and left-wing lawmakers in France joined together to vote on a no-confidence motion prompted by budget disputes that will force Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign.

The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies presents significant challenges, making it essential for investors to adopt practices that safeguard their investments.\nFor a deeper understanding of risk management in cryptocurrency investing, read TheStreet Crypto's interview with Cambrian Asset Management's president Tony Fenner-Leitão below:\nTony Fenner-Leitão, President of Cambrian Asset Management: Volatility is an inherent feature of cryptocurrency markets, and navigating it requires robust risk management. A cornerstone of any strategy is appropriate position sizing. By limiting exposure to any single asset, investors can ensure that no one position jeopardizes the overall portfolio.\nImportantly investors should consider what role a crypto investment will play in their broader portfolios. Some approaches, typically employed by managers, can, for example, provide diversification and downside protection as well as exposure to potential higher expected returns. In this case a portfolio may actually benefit from what may seem like a disproportionately high allocation to cryptocurrencies.\nMaintaining a long-term focus is essential. Day trading and short-term speculation often lead to suboptimal outcomes, particularly for less experienced participants. By adopting a long-term approach , individual investors can not only safeguard their capital but also position themselves to capitalize on market recoveries.\nFor new investors, cryptocurrencies offer both significant potential opportunity and considerable risk. An initial key step is to decide on investment objectives. This leads to a series of decisions: to invest actively or passively, direct or via a manager. These approaches all have advantages and risks and depend on investor objectives. These decisions are especially important if the investor wishes to make a significant and long term commitment to this asset class. Encouragingly there are an increasing number of options available: ETFs, Futures and dedicated investment managers. Unlike in private markets, liquid managers have detailed monthly track records which allows an investor to understand the underlying strategy and how it performed in various market environments. The second important step is to link an investor's key objectives with an underlying strategy. If an investor has a high level of appetite for risk, feels confident of market timing and not being shaken out by sharp falls, then a passive beta or even leveraged approach might be appropriate. If an investor, on the other hand, cares about a “risk-adjusted” earnings profile then they would look to implement a strategy (directly or via a manager) that focuses on protecting downside, whilst still offering attractive absolute upside.\nIndustry platforms for news and analysis will help, as will on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode or Dune Analytics, which provide insights into network activity, token flows, and investor behavior, giving a more data-driven perspective.\nSome engagement with the crypto community through forums, social media, or developer updates on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Discord can be helpful for detail on gauging sentiment and staying abreast of emerging trends.\nFinally, monitoring market and regulatory developments is equally important, as evolving policies can significantly impact the market, along with new products such as ETFs, options, futures."]}

Throughout the day on Thursday, though, the value rose as high as $103,844.\nHere's how much a $1,000 investment in bitcoin made one, five or 10 years ago would be worth based on the digital currency's Dec. 5 midmorning price of $101,564, according to CNBC calculations.\nHere's how that compares with the S&P 500 index, which is often viewed as a benchmark of the overall stock market.\nOne potential reason behind the surge may be some of Wall Street's key institutions' embrace of bitcoin.\nSeveral large investment firms including Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity Investments launched the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in January. Since an ETF tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, bitcoin ETFs provide a way to invest, and benefit from potential price movements, without owning the cryptocurrency itself.\nWith the availability of bitcoin ETFs, a larger number of investors can gain access to bitcoin. And as demand rises, so does the price, Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council, told CNBC Make It on January 5.\nBitcoin's value has fluctuated wildly over the past few years. The virtual currency hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, only to lose around 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX, the largest crypto exchange at the time, in November 2022.\nSince then, though, it has made a steady recovery and is up around 125% year over year, per CoinMetrics.\nWhile bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, all crypto isn't bitcoin. Experts warn against attempting to predict how other cryptocurrencies or meme coins may behave based on bitcoin's price movements.\nCryptocurrencies are considered speculative assets and are prone to unexpected surges and drops in value. Unlike stocks, which represent partial ownership in a company, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by an underlying asset. That's why experts often warn against investing more than you're willing to lose.\nIf you want to \"try your luck\" with crypto investing, consider opting for buying a bitcoin ETF through your brokerage account, James Royal, Bankrate's principal investing and wealth management analyst, told CNBC Make It in May.\n\"The annual fees are reasonable, cheaper in most cases than actually buying the crypto yourself, and you're buying a coin that has the interest of institutional investors, so demand may remain robust,\" he said.\nIf you feel you must have crypto in your portfolio, make it a small portion of your investments, Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut, told CNBC Make It in January.\n\"I'd say 1% on the more conservative side, and no more than 5% of your total portfolio if you're a growth-focused investor,\" Vendig said.\nWant to make extra money outside of your day job? Sign up for CNBC's online course How to Earn Passive Income Online to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.","Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders find themselves in a challenging position as the once dominant meme coin struggles to regain its former momentum. Despite a brief rally that brought SHIB close to a key resistance level, the chances of SHIB price reaching $1 are slim to one for the next few decades. While SHIB is facing uncertainty, a newcomer, Rexas Finance, is capturing attention with its ambitious projections. Analysts anticipate the token will rally to $1 in the coming weeks and rocket past $10 as the upcoming altcoin season gains momentum. Currently in presale, the real-world asset tokenization altcoin has seen remarkable success, raising over $22 million. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Struggles to Reach $1 While Shiba Inu (SHIB) occasional spikes in market optimism provide brief hope, it consistently hits resistance at critical price points. Its Network Value to Transactions ratio suggests the token's valuation may be disconnected from its actual network utility, raising concerns about sustainability. With over 416 trillion SHIB held by investors waiting to recover losses, the token would need a significant 25% rally to bring many holders back into profit. In addition, Shiba Inu has a massive circulating supply of over 589 trillion tokens. To reach a price of $1, the market capitalization of SHIB would need to increase to nearly $600 trillion, which is highly unlikely.\nRexas Finance (RXS): Unlocking RWA Tokenization Rexas Finance is transforming the cryptocurrency landscape by bringing real world asset (RWA) tokenization to a broader audience. It digitizes various assets, such as real estate, commodities, and artwork, offering fractional ownership opportunities with just a few clicks. This means high value markets are made accessible to investors of all budgets. With this solution, individuals can own a share in premium properties worldwide. Rexas finance stands out with its intuitive token builder tool, enabling users to seamlessly create and manage asset backed tokens. Additionally, the Rexas Launchpad provides businesses with a streamlined way to raise capital by issuing tokens to potential investors. To further simplify the process, Rexas Finance's QuickMint Bot, designed for compatibility with multiple blockchains, makes minting tokens easy and user-friendly, even for those new to the crypto space.\nRexas Finance Presale Success The Rexas Finance (RXS) presale continues to outperform expectations, with stages 1 through 8 selling out and amassing $20.75 million in funds. Currently in stage 9, tokens are available at $0.125 each, with the total raised climbing to $22,609,638 demonstrating robust interest from investors. Participants at this stage stand to benefit from a projected launch price of $0.20, representing a potential 1.6x return. By choosing a public presale over traditional venture capital funding, Rexas Finance prioritizes inclusivity allowing investors to take part in its journey from the ground up. This promotes fairer access to investment opportunities and sets the stage for a significant transformation in the way real-world assets are tokenized and traded.\nThe Rexas Finance $1M Giveaway Rexas Finance is making waves through its innovative asset tokenization and also by engaging its community with the exciting Rexas Millionaire Giveaway. This initiative promises a total of $1 million in prizes, with 20 lucky participants each receiving $50,000. To make the contest even more, a referral program allows users to boost their chances of winning while fostering stronger community engagement and drawing new investors to the platform. Rexas Finance is gearing up for its debut on three major cryptocurrency exchanges. These high profile listings will significantly enhance the liquidity and accessibility of the RXS token, making it easier for both retail and institutional investors to participate. This strategic move is poised to amplify interest in Rexas Finance, paving the way for broader adoption and sustained growth in the long run.\nListed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko Rexas finance reached a milestone by being listed on the most reputable cryptocurrency platforms CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. With millions of users visiting the sites each month, this achievement provides Rexas with high visibility among global crypto investors.\nFinal Thoughts Despite its prominence in the meme coin market, Shiba Inu continues to fall short of the elusive $1 mark. Even with aggressive token burns, it is unlikely that SHIB will ever reach $1. On the other hand, RWA leader Rexas Finance is expected to breach through the mark shortly after launch. In addition, RXS is projected to climb above $10 during the upcoming bull run. Currently priced at $0.125, Rexas Finance sets itself apart as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in during this cycle.\nFor more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below: Website: https:\/\/rexas.com Win $1 Million Giveaway: https:\/\/bit.ly\/Rexas1M Whitepaper: https:\/\/rexas.com\/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter\/X: https:\/\/x.com\/rexasfinance Telegram: https:\/\/t.me\/rexasfinance\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","06th Dec, 2024. 03:42 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on May 28, 2025\nAs of Dec 6, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $98261.06.

That’s exactly what’s happening for Dogecoin. Namely, DOGE investors made over 160% gains in November 2024. Now, most of them are selling their DOGE coins. Experts say that this is normal and expected. So, they’re not worried about Dogecoin at the moment. \nExperts also say that this profit-taking will continue for Dogecoin in December. So, a dip for DOGE is in store. More specifically, experts say that DOGE could dip by around 25% due to profit-taking. However, after that, Dogecoin will recover.\nAnalyst Trader Tardigrade agrees. He says that DOGE’s price will increase more in 2025. The reason behind this is Dogecoin is now in a green zone. So, this analyst expects DOGE to bring big profits in the next two years. \n\n\n\nSHIB Investors are Also Taking Profits While They Can\nShiba Inu didn’t perform as well as DOGE did. Even though SHIB is popular, it didn’t really make waves in November’s rally. Still, Shiba Inu investors made over 70% in profits. Now, SHIB is dipping. That’s because Shiba Inu investors are securing profits while they can. \nShiba Inu is also losing people’s interest. Experts have noticed that people like other meme coins like DOGE more than they like SHIB. So, they’re expecting Shiba Inu to dip much more than DOGE will. \nThey say that SHIB could erase all the gains it made in November. So, a 70% pullback might be in store for SHIB soon. After that, Shiba Inu can still recover.\nHowever, experts say that SHIB’s recovery won’t be anything big. They say that people are showing more interest in other meme coins. That’s why SHIB won’t ever be able to repeat the 2021 meme coin run again. \nFXGuys: A New Crypto Trading Platform That Can Repeat the 2021 Meme Coin Run!\nFXGuys is one of the few tokens that can repeat the 2021 meme coin run.

Learn More\nI have to admit, when crypto pundits were forecasting the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price was headed north of US$100,000 a few years ago I thought that was rather pie in the sky.\nToday, my pie-in-the-sky dismissal has turned into humble pie as the world's original and biggest cryptocurrency blasted through that milestone overnight to set a new all-time high of US$103,900.\nWhile longer-term buy-and-hold investors have certainly done well, the gains haven't come without plenty of the volatility we've come to expect in crypto markets. In the past 24 hours alone, the Bitcoin price traded as low as US$91,999 and as high as the new overnight record US$103,900.\nThat's quite a range.\nAt the time of writing on Friday, BTC has dipped to US$98,578. Which means it still would have made it an excellent Christmas present last year, when it was trading for just US$40,075 on 25 December.\nAt the current price, Bitcoin has a total market valuation of US$1.95 trillion (AU$2.95 trillion). So even Elon Musk no longer has enough money to buy them all, though the world's richest man has long been a proponent of cryptocurrencies.\nCommenting on the Bitcoin price smashing through the US$100,000 mark, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said (quoted by The Australian):\nWe noted that after yesterday's burst above $100K, there had been very little follow-through buying. We also highlighted signs of exhaustion and bearish divergence, which are excellent indicators of a short-term high.\nAddressing the volatile price action, Sycamore added, \"This spike in volatility over the last 24 hours has the hallmarks of a classic blow-off top. While we don't see this as the end of the Bitcoin bull run, it does signal we are entering a consolidation phase in the days\/weeks ahead.\"\nMike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy added (quoted by Bloomberg), \"We are witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, Bitcoin and the entire digital-asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream.\"\nIndeed, it was only back on 5 November that the Bitcoin price stood at US$67,811.\nAs you're likely aware, that date marked the US presidential election. And it saw Donald Trump, a big advocate of cryptocurrencies, sweep back into office.\nAccording to Novogratz:\nOver the long term, I'm bullish. It won't be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the US, it'll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.\nAtop some strong tailwinds from the incoming Trump administration, the Bitcoin price has also been getting added support from a range of spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States.\nYi He, co-founder of Binance, credited a decade of ongoing efforts from crypto believers for pushing Bitcoin to the US$100,000 mark.\n\"The significance of Bitcoin's price breaking through the $100,000 milestone lies in providing the public with a powerful memory point, showing that those unbelievable things are really happening,\" He said.\nHe added, \"The small, persistent efforts accumulated day-by-day over the past decade by members of the crypto community will ultimately converge into this historic scene.\"\nMay 22, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nThe Bitcoin price just smashed through US$110,000.

According to Green, previous cycles have shown a 100x increase from the bottom, which could imply a theoretical peak of $1.5 million for this cycle. \"Now, I think that that's a crazy number,\" he admitted, \"But that would just be kind of us following the previous trends.\"\nIn the shorter-term, it does seem worthwhile to point to analysts that have come close to hitting their bullish calls from the beginning of the year. While calls for bitcoin to hit $200,000 seem out of the money with just about 20 days to go in the year, Fundstrat's call for $115,000 (which was made back in January) still seems achievable.\nDrawing comparisons to past halvings, Green noted striking parallels in price movements. \"The price during the halving of 2016 was $650. The price during the halving of 2024 was $65,000,\" he observed. By this logic, he suggested the possibility of bitcoin hitting $2 million by the cycle's end wasn't as preposterous as it sounds.\nWhile the predictions may seem bold, Green emphasized the market's bullish tailwinds. \"There's plenty of bullish tailwinds that are kind of pushing the market forward,\" he remarked. Whether bitcoin reaches these milestones remains uncertain, but the discussion underscores the optimism surrounding its long-term growth.","09th Dec, 2024. 03:39 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Jan 24, 2024\nAs of Dec 9, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $98505.92.

Technically, tokenization is the process of deploying the rights to own a physical or non-physical asset onto a blockchain in the form of ‘tokens’. For asset owners and investors, this procedure guarantees better transparency and accessibility, improves liquidity, and allows flawless trade. The RWA tokenization business was already valued at $118.6 billion by September 2024; forecasts show that by 2030, this sector might reach a trillion-dollar worldwide value. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a key player in this changing terrain because of its creative platform positioning and good presale performance. However, can RWA tokenization sector growth push RXS crypto price to $100 by 2030? Understanding RWA Tokenization and Its Potential Real-world asset tokenization is transforming conventional asset markets by tackling some long-standing inefficiencies. Traditional asset trading sometimes requires limited access, sluggish procedures, and middlemen. Tokenization removes these obstacles, facilitating fractional ownership, reduced transaction costs, and instantaneous settlements. Any asset can be tokenized from real estate and art to goods and intellectual property, providing access to more general investing possibilities. Big financial companies are increasingly using blockchain technology to assist RWA tokenization. The growing need for transparency, improving asset liquidity, and a wish to release the great wealth locked up in illiquid assets drive the worldwide push toward digitalizing assets. The industry is set to see explosive expansion as infrastructure supporting the ownership, trading, and transfer of RWA tokens ages develops. For blockchain-based initiatives such as Rexas Finance (RXS), this offers a great chance to profit from the market's growth. The Role of Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a pioneering platform designed to simplify and democratize the tokenization of real-world assets. With unmatched simplicity, the platform lets users tokenize holdings, including real estate, fine art, and commodities, building a distributed marketplace between conventional finance and blockchain technology. Thanks to this innovation, RXS stands out among the RWA players. As of its ninth stage, the project had raised over $22.42 million, and the token is valued at $0.125. The project attracted great momentum during its presale. Rexas Finance chose a public presale instead of many blockchain initiatives depending on venture capitalist money to guarantee broad involvement and complement its democratizing goal. Strong presale performance indicates that the choice resonates with investors. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance, a hallmark of security and reliability in the crypto industry, will add to investor confidence. Plans to list three of the top 10 Tier 1 exchanges will improve visibility and liquidity for RXS at its complete debut, fueling the momentum of the token's expected listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. RWA Tokenization Growth and Its Impact on RXS Price The projected growth of the RWA tokenization sector into a trillion-dollar industry by 2030 is a critical factor that could drive the price of RXS to $100. As adoption accelerates, blockchain projects offering scalable and effective solutions will experience more demand for their tokens. Rexas Finance's strong platform, user-oriented design, and expanding community of investors help it be positioned to gain from this trend. What distinguishes Rexas Finance is its capacity to enable customers to tokenize practically any real-world asset from anywhere globally. Accessibility and creativity build the platform's value proposition, allowing both fractional and complete ownership of assets. This adaptability is expected to draw in both institutional investors and retail players, generating a virtuous cycle of token demand. RXS's use will increase as it is increasingly included in the expanding tokenized asset network, influencing its price rise. Furthermore, how RXS is expected to list on three Tier 1 exchanges will improve market reach and liquidity, enabling a steady price increase. Furthermore, governments and financial behemoths will continuously construct RWA tokenization infrastructure, fostering conditions favorable for initiatives like Rexas Finance. As more assets are tokenized and exchanged on blockchain systems, reliable, creative, and user-friendly solutions will become more sought after, confirming RXS's place in the market. Conclusion The growing acceptance of tokenization might propel RXS to the $100 mark by 2030 as the RWA sector grows into a trillion-dollar market. Investors looking to profit from this transforming trend could find RXS to be a convincing prospect.

Wood also added a new bull case that includes the potential highest price Bitcoin could reach by 2030 if companies allocated 5% to Bitcoin.\nWith Bitcoin trading at $97,106.64 at the time of writing, an investor could buy 0.00103 BTC today with $100. Here is a look at how much that $100 would be worth in the future under Wood’s various price targets.\nBear Case, $258,500: $100 today would be worth $266.26, up 166.3%\nBase Case, $682,000: $100 today would be worth $702.46, up 602.5%\nBull Case, $1,480,000: $100 today would be worth $1,524.40, up 1,424.4%\nBullish Case, $3,800,000: $100 today would be worth $3,914.00, up 3,814.0%\n**This syndication was originally published on Dec 9th so the forecast numbers are based up to that date.\nAs you can see, a small investment would turn into a sizable return if Wood's base or bullish predictions come true. Even the bearish price target hitting would more than double the investment from today.\nWhile there's no guarantee that any of the price targets will hit, the exercise shows how a small investment in cryptocurrency could add up over time.\nRead Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nWhat’s Next: Wood recently reiterated her price targets in a CNBC interview while highlighting how Ark Invest was early to investing in Bitcoin.\n“We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin in 2015 at $250,” Wood said.\nWood said that even with Bitcoin trading around $90,000, the company believes there is a long way to go.\nThe fund manager said that getting regulatory relief with a new administration is one of the most important things for Bitcoin. Wood also sees Bitcoin being viewed as a new asset class, leading to more institutions and asset allocators wanting to invest in the top cryptocurrency.\nWood's Ark Invest was also one of several companies to have a Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC with its Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (BATS:ARKB).\nWood’s most recent $3.8 million price target might be one of the biggest from a fund manager and among the most bullish bets on cryptocurrency. The target came from Bitcoin ETFs’ approval and early success earlier this year.\n\"With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you,\" Wood said.\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nAdding $2.3 million to the $1.5 million results in a new 2030 price target of $3.8 million.\nThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs led Wood to say in an interview that \"the probability of the bull case has increased.\"\nWood and Ark Invest aren’t just betting on the success of Bitcoin with its cryptocurrency holdings and the ETF, the company is also investing in crypto-related companies.\nThe flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has Coinbase Holdings (NASDAQ:COIN) as its second-largest holding, accounting for 10.0% of its assets. Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is the fund’s sixth-largest holding, accounting for 5.1% of its assets.\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,900.47 on Dec. 4, one of several records set after the 2024 election.\nRead Next:\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Its AI-driven consensus and AIVM make it the blockchain choice for forward-thinkers who see AI as the backbone of the future. \n\nDecentralized Intelligence \n\n  Solana excels at transactions, but Lightchain’s integration of AI tasks ushers in a new era of intelligent blockchains capable of adapting and evolving with global AI advancements. \nThe Clock Is Ticking \nBlockchain technology is evolving faster than the blink of an eye, and investment opportunities like this don’t wait around.

Learn More\nThis article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\nCryptocurrencies had another great day on Wednesday, and the biggest tokens led the market. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is once again trading above $100,000, which is a critical psychological level for traders.\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, in the past 24 hours alone, Bitcoin is up 5.3%, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has jumped 5.2%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is up 7.9%.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics announced this morning the closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up 2.7% from a year ago, 0.1% higher than in October, but in line with estimates.\nTraders are now convinced this will be the final data point needed to cut the federal funds rate to between 4.25% and 4.5% later this month. According to the CME, the odds of a cut are now at 94.9%.\nAs much as crypto bulls want to say cryptocurrencies are about upending the current financial system, the biggest driver of higher values in crypto is interest rates and the actions of the Federal Reserve. When rates were going up, crypto fell, and now that rates are coming down, crypto is rising again.\nThat shows crypto is trading more like a speculative asset than based on any fundamentals.\nThe moves higher in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since early November were all about the election. But that trade seems to be slowing as it gets priced into the market and traders look for the next catalyst. They found it today with lower rates, which could make borrowing less expensive and theoretically drive more economic activity.\nThat's the same narrative that drove crypto in 2020 and 2021, but reversed when interest rates started rising. We are now back to the old themes, with trading dependent on rates for tailwinds or headwinds.\nI will note that while the federal funds rate gets the most attention, the 10-year rate is more important to businesses borrowing money to grow. And that rate is still up sharply in the last three months and flat for 2024.\n10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts\nThe changes in interest rates and potential regulation of crypto will be good for the industry, but not in the ways a lot of tokens are moving. I think it's real utility, like lower-cost financial transactions, stock trades on the blockchain, and subscriptions or loyalty programs on the blockchain, that will be unlocked from a changing administration.\nSome of that value may flow to tokens themselves, but Bitcoin and Ethereum are notoriously slow and costly blockchains, and Dogecoin is a meme coin. It's unlikely these are the places entrepreneurs build real businesses in 2025 and beyond. Those businesses will likely be built on other blockchains.\nMomentum is strong in crypto today, and that may last for some time. But the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin will only go higher as long as more money is flowing into the ecosystem. And that momentum may stop as signs of a worsening economy continue to percolate through the economy.\nThis article was originally published on Fool.com.

Ohman J:or Fonder AB — to move forward.\nThe Supreme Court opted not resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been granted.\nIts action leaves the lower court’s decision in place.\nThe Supreme Court’s dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.\nDuring the arguments, some of the justices expressed reservations about intervening in the case.\nThey wondered about whether there was a clear legal issue for them to decide, as opposed to just a dispute over facts, and indicated that they were not ideally placed to resolve the case given its technical complexities.\nAt issue was whether the plaintiffs cleared the heightened legal bar for bringing private securities fraud suits set under a 1995 federal law called the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that aimed to screen out frivolous litigation.\nThe plaintiffs accused Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang of violating a 1934 federal law called the Securities Exchange Act by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia’s revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\nBeginning in 2017, as the price of certain cryptocurrencies rose, Nvidia’s chips became increasingly popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.\nBy late 2018, amid a decline in crypto profitability, Nvidia’s revenue fell short of its projections, leading its stock price to fall in early November of that year.\nThe plaintiffs accused Nvidia and its top officials of concealing the impact of cryptomining on its business.\nThe suit seeks unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Nvidia stock held by the investors.\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to US authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business, but without admitting or denying the findings of federal regulators.\nA federal judge dismissed the shareholder lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made “false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,” allowing their case to proceed.\nDeepak Gupta, who represented the shareholders before the Supreme Court, called the dismissal “a win for corporate accountability.”\n“The corporate Supreme Court bar, supported by the U.S. Chamber (of Commerce) and its allies, often tries to gin up nonexistent legal issues in an effort to curtail class actions,” Gupta said. “We hope the court will think twice the next time a corporation uses the same playbook.”\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company is “fully prepared to continue our defense. Consistent and predictable standards in securities litigation are essential to protecting shareholders and ensuring a strong economy, and we remain committed to supporting them,” the spokesperson said.\nNvidia argued to the Supreme Court that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately show that the disputed corporate statements were false, or the company had intentionally or recklessly misled investors, as required by law.\nThe plaintiffs countered that their lawsuit contained strong enough allegations – gleaned from former employees, market analysis and expert opinion — to survive Nvidia’s request for dismissal and proceed to the discovery stage of litigation.\nPresident Biden’s administration supported the shareholders in the case.\nThe Nvidia dispute was one of two case to come before the Supreme Court in November involving the right private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud.\nThe other one, involving Meta’s Facebook, was argued on Nov. 6 and similarly dismissed by the justices on Nov. 22.\nAdvertisement","The U.S. Supreme Court chose not to make a decision on Wednesday concerning a securities fraud lawsuit against AI chipmaker Nvidia. The lawsuit alleged that Nvidia misled investors about its reliance on the cryptocurrency market, a claim stemming from a 2018 class action initiated by Stockholm-based E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB.\nThe Supreme Court, deciding the case should not have been taken up, left in place a lower court's ruling allowing the case to move forward. This decision was articulated in a single-line order, offering no detailed explanation. The justices expressed hesitance during the arguments, questioning the clarity of the legal issue at hand.\nThe core question was whether the plaintiffs met the strict requirements for private securities fraud suits under the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The accusations against Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang centered on allegedly minimizing how much revenue growth was tied to the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","11th Dec, 2024. 04:03 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 5, 2024\nAs of Dec 11, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $98184.45.

It is making waves as very affordable and yet holding immense upside potential. The more the partnerships and developments occur, the more returns the early investors are going to receive. By solving real-world issues such as scalability and cost, Aureal One has positioned itself as the next crypto to explode. Its growing excitement around its ecosystem can drive its price much higher by the end of 2024.\n2. DexBoss(DEBO)\nDexBoss has emerged as one of the giants in decentralised finance, changing the way traders interact with cryptocurrency. DexBoss supports more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies and is known for its high-leverage trading and near real-time order execution on the platform. It attracts veterans as well as new investors who are friendly in crypto trading. Its token, $DEBO, began at $0.01 presale, and it will grow to $0.15; hence, it rewards participants handsomely.\n\n\n\nThis should increase the worth of DEBO based on the expansion of this protocol. Meanwhile, staking and liquidity farming are integrated into DexBoss. That is one aspect that allows a proper setup for deriving passives. At any one point in time, chances are DexBoss may most likely surpass DeFi as one of the cryptocurrencies to inflate quickly.\n3. yPredict (YPRED)\nyPredict is changing the game in the art of predictive analytics by traders and businesses with the combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain. It is built for data-driven decisions and uses the most advanced AI algorithms for predicting market trends to ensure that investors stay ahead of the curve. yPredict’s ecosystem has staking, governance, and access to predictive models built by data scientists, making it a holistic tool for crypto enthusiasts.\nThe site is anchored on its native token, YPRED. It encourages model creators while rewarding users. The token prices are set attractively low, and the buzz is growing rapidly. The analyst feels a unique combination of AI and blockchain will attract institutional investors and retail investors, thereby making yPredict an explosive candidate for exponential growth, hence the next crypto to explode.\n4. Render Token (RNDR)\nRender Token, or RNDR has stormed the creative industry, connecting artists and studios to decentralised GPU power for rendering digital projects. Its user base that can monetize unused GPU resources has grown explosively while sustaining a growing ecosystem of visual effects, animation, and game development.\nAs of the last update, RNDR trades at $2.50 and has skyrocketed by over 200% within a year. With the metaverse and augmented reality applications pushing up the demand for high-quality rendering, Render Token is likely to benefit the most from this. Many investors calculate that RNDR can blow the next crypto market surge with its innovative approach and investing opportunities.\n\n\n\n5. Decentraland (MANA)\nDecentraland is known for its virtual reality metaverse platform, it always surprises investors with its rise in the market. MANA remains its native token, where all its users can buy, sell, and even create digital assets, like virtual lands. MANA has touched as high as $5.85 during the last bull run, which only proves a great upward potential. Decentraland, still leading the way in innovation, is now part of mainstream consciousness as people take their metaverse stories further. Fluctuating market prices have not dimmed many analysts’ forecasts of MANA reclaiming past highs or going beyond these levels in the next bullish trend. It continues solidifying its place as a market leader due to its integration with blockchain and VR.\n6. Stacks (STX)\nStacks uses smart contract capability with Bitcoin through its novel Proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism. It is the work of Layer-2 Scaling that amplifies the utility brought about by Bitcoin as well as makes use of its network in propagating decentralized applications and, above all, smart contracts. Priced competitively and having a strong technological foundation, Stacks has attracted an increasing number of developers and users. Its alignment with the security and scalability of Bitcoin places it as a secure investment, making it another contender for the next crypto to explode.\nConclusion\nWhile each of these 6 coins has something unique, Aureal One is all about innovation, utility, and affordability. It has grasped its niche by responding to some of the core issues that will define future market requirements and metaverse ecosystems: transaction speed and cost. Its roadmap and community-driven growth make it very attractive for investments from those seeking exponential returns. The crypto market is volatile, but for those who want to catch the next big wave, Aureal One is a well-balanced mix of risk and reward. With its presale pricing and long-term vision, this coin has all the makings of the next crypto to explode. As market momentum builds, Aureal One could redefine how investors approach blockchain gaming and metaverse opportunities, delivering returns that exceed expectations.\nThePrint BrandStand content is a paid-for, sponsored article.

He criticized Chairman Gary Gensler’s approach, revealing Ripple spent over $150 million defending the non-security status of Ripple’s XRP.\nBesides, XRP’s price has grown over 340% in the past month and was trading around $2.45 on December 9. Analysts say that XRP has entered a consolidation phase within a descending wedge pattern following a strong bullish rally. \nAnalysts have also identified $2.04 and $1.86 as key buy zones. If XRP rebounds from these buy zones, analysts predict an initial target of $2.62 and even $2.99. A $100 invested into Ripple’s XRP won’t give a significant return, considering these forecasts.\n\n\n\nSolana ETF Faces Rejection Under Current SEC Leadership\nThe US SEC has reportedly notified two out of five Solana ETF issuers of plans to reject their 19b-4 filings. The SEC hasn’t officially rejected filings from Bitwise or 21Shares, but skepticism about short-term approval keeps the Solana ETF market stagnant.\nOn the other hand, SOL was trading at around $230 in early December 2024, with a price increase of 14% in the past month. Solana bulls are defending the $226 support level, which previously triggered a rally to $264 on November 17.\nThe bulls are hoping Solana will reclaim ATH again. However, increased selling pressure could lead SOL to test the $220 support level. Thus, investing $100 in Solana will also not generate great returns as compared to XRP and $FXG.\nFXGuys Turns Trading Talent Into Wealth with Funding and Exclusive Rewards\nCompared to XRP and SOL, $FXG offers the best return to investors due to its greater utility in its ecosystem. Through FXGuys’ staking rewards program, investors can stake their $FXG tokens and add a passive income option.\nIn addition, the $FXG token will also go up in price over time and the rewards from staking will also get bigger. Users will earn 20% of revenue shares of the platform. Experts say that the FXGuys prop firm has helped many traders with poor financial backgrounds with its Trader Funding Program.\n\n\n\nTraders can participate in the program and win the challenges in flexible time to get funded accounts up to $500,000. If a trader is skilled but doesn’t have upfront capital, FXGuys helps them showcase their skill and make money.\nTraders will keep up an 80% profit split, and they will also earn $FXG tokens for trading. It doesn’t matter if your trade makes a profit or not; you will get a reward. These rewards can be used for premium tools, lower profit targets, and increased drawdown limits.\nMoreover, the FX Guys platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows traders to track progress and monitor challenge statistics effortlessly.

And now, of course, we've got artificial intelligence.\nMichael Saylor says bitcoin is the next technology wave, and the co-founder and chief executive of MicroStrategy  (MSTR) , the world's biggest holder of bitcoin, was more than willing to share his feelings with the people at Microsoft  (MSFT) .\nSaylor, a bitcoin evangelist, appeared at the Redmond, Wash., software giant's virtual shareholder meeting on Dec. 10 in a bid to persuade the company to invest in bitcoin.\nShares of MicroStrategy, which owns 2% of the total supply of bitcoin, have skyrocketed by a factor of more than six year to date.\nAnd bitcoin itself surpassed $100,000 for the first time late on Dec. 4, The world’s largest cryptocurrency has more than doubled (up 142%) this year.\n\"Microsoft cannot afford to miss the next technology wave,\" Saylor said in a Dec. 1 video he posted on X. \"And bitcoin is that wave. Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century. It represents digital capital.\"\n💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸\nSaylor spoke on behalf of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project, which sent a nearly identical proposal to Amazon  (AMZN)  and may do the same with other corporations, according to Ethan Peck, deputy director of the shareholder activist group, according to Bloomberg.\nThe Free Enterprise Project describes itself as \"the original and premier opponent of the woke takeover of American corporate life.\"\n“If you are going to outperform, you are going to need bitcoin,” Saylor said at the meeting, later adding, “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to your stock price.”\nRelated: Analysts revisit Adobe stock price targets after Q4 earnings\nMicrosoft’s board had come out earlier against the proposal, saying it already had evaluated cryptocurrencies.\nInvestors rejected a ballot proposal asking the board to assess whether diversifying the balance sheet by including bitcoin is in the best long-term interests of shareholders.\nProxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services concurred with that call. Glass Lewis pointed to expert reports that said there’s no guarantee that adding cryptocurrency will improve a portfolio’s returns, for example.\nBy the way, TheStreet Pro's Doug Kass has no love for MicroStrategy, telling readers that the only the difference between Saylor's company and bankrupted crypto exchange FTX \"is that MSTR is not a fraud — it is simply an Enron-like math scheme that will likely eventually eviscerate much of the money invested in the company (inmho).\"\nThe incoming Trump administration has promised to support cryptocurrency.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump, who rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 12, told CNBC's Jim Cramer that \"I think so. We're going to do something great with crypto.\"\nEric Trump, the president-elect's son, said during an appearance at a cryptocurrency conference in the United Arab Emirates that \"you're going to have the most pro-crypto president in the history of America,\" The New York Times reported.\n\"Think about a president who wasn't going to allow bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be overregulated and stifled,\" the younger Trump said.\nTheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle has his own take on the next technology wave, and, spoiler alert, it ain't bitcoin.\n\"While not necessarily being anti-crypto, the next technology wave is generative AI and the one after that is quantum computing,\" Guilfoyle said, referring to the technology that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than classic computers.\n\"The blockchain is no longer cutting-edge technology,\" he said.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nSuper Micro's stock price surges after key ruling\nVeteran trader takes a fresh look at Sofi Technologies\nDruckenmiller predicted Nvidia's rally, now has new AI target\nGuilfoyle, whose career dates back to the NYSE floor in the 1980s, cited a recent note from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who told investors that Trump’s choice of Andrew Ferguson to head the Federal Trade Commission, succeeding Lina Kahn, essentially means that “Christmas came early for the tech world.”\n“In our decades of covering tech stocks, the ‘Friday the 13th horror show’ for the tech world that Khan has become over the years is now over, which means dealmaking in the tech world is about to significantly increase heading into 2025 with the popcorn ready,” Ives wrote.\nThe analyst said that having a pro-innovation FTC chairman is a huge positive for the tech world, \"and we also believe any chances of tech breakups goes down significantly with Khan gone from the 202 area code,\" a reference to the three digits you dial when you call Washington.\nRelated: Kroger, Albertsons prep defenses, announce plans after merger collapses\nIn reviewing Microsoft, Guilfoyle said that the S&P 500 is up about 27.5% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq 100 has done even better and is up 28.7%.\n\"I don't like to complain about a stock that is up 19% year to date, but Microsoft, which over the years has been great to me, has been a weight upon both of those indices,\" he said. \"For years, Microsoft had been the top holding in my most active portfolio.\"\nGuilfoyle said he was and remains a big believer in Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, but the investor added that the software and cloud giant had fallen to his sixth-largest long position, \"partially due to the outperformance of several other names and partially because I had reduced my allocation toward the name.\"\nThe veteran traded unveiled a new price target of $512 for Microsoft.\n\"I think it may be time to either get back into MSFT if one has been out, or increase the allocation if one, like me, was not out but had put the stock on the back burner,\" he said.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager delivers alarming S&P 500 forecast","12th Dec, 2024. 03:53 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on May 25, 2025\nAs of Dec 12, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $100538.21.

It becoming a mainstream asset could make this cycle higher,” he added.\nHolmes shared his bullish perspective, drawing attention to bitcoin's smallest unit, the Satoshi, and its potential value. \"It makes it very conceivable and easy to digest that bitcoin goes to a million dollars as this adoption takes place,” he explained, comparing bitcoin’s rarity to a Picasso artwork. \"As more people fall in love with Picasso, it grows exponentially in price... bitcoin will rise as more people adopt.\"\nMelker pointed out catalysts that could expedite bitcoin’s growth, including the idea of it becoming a reserve asset. \"If the United States actually makes bitcoin a reserve asset... that could send it much higher, much faster than anticipated,” he said. Holmes further emphasized the importance of educating the public that bitcoin is divisible, allowing participation without the need to purchase a full coin.\nTurning to Hive Digital Technologies' plans, Holmes highlighted their expansion into Paraguay. \"We’ve locked up the machines for Paraguay... Their government’s utility company gets paid every month, and they’re getting U.S. dollars,” Holmes stated, emphasizing the economic benefits of bitcoin mining.

At the time, the Bitcoin price was trading between US$60,000 and US$70,000.\nCommenting on AMP's groundbreaking Bitcoin investment, University of New South Wales economics professor Richard Holden said (quoted by the AFR):\nWhen president-elect Donald Trump says it is a legitimate asset class, it's not going to go anywhere soon and it's only going to grow.\nIn that context, it is understandable that a fund manager would want to have a moderate level of exposure. I do, however, worry about mum and dad investors giving over large portions of their retirement or other savings outside the professionally managed super environment.\nWestpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) chief economist Luci Ellis sounded a more cautious note.\nAccording to Ellis:\nIt doesn't have a stable value, you can't really use it for payments except in very rare circumstances, and it doesn't have a running yield. It's not like equities that entitle you to a flow of dividends, or a bond that entitles you to a flow of interest payments.\nThe Bitcoin price is up 136% in 2024.\nMay 22, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nThe Bitcoin price just smashed through US$110,000.

Farrell attributed Ethereum’s previous sluggish performance to an overlooked factor: the market’s perception of the world's second largest crypto by market cap within traditional finance (TradFi).\n\"Fundamentally, I think the issue is that the marginal buyer for Ethereum right now is TradFi,\" Farrell explained. \"It is integrated with TradFi. It has CME futures. It has ETFs now... It takes a lot of liquidity to move it in a way that would produce outsized gains.\"\nDespite this, Farrell highlighted emerging signs of institutional adoption that could drive Ethereum higher. \"We have seen ETH ETF flows tick a lot higher... from a rate of change basis, ETF flows have been solid,\" he noted. These developments signal growing confidence from traditional investors. According to CoinShares, Ethereum has seen crypto investment flows stay positive for seven consecutive weeks.\nAnother factor boosting Ethereum’s prospects is a shift in macroeconomic conditions. \"A lot of the macro data that I'm looking at is really in what I would consider, you know, Goldilocks territory,\" Farrell remarked. He pointed out that favorable inflation data and a dovish Federal Reserve could create a supportive environment for risk assets like ETH.\nFarrell also acknowledged ETH’s evolving narrative within investment circles. \"Through conversations with crypto-curious TradFi market participants, I think they really view it as this unprofitable tech stock,\" he said. This characterization has led some institutional players to approach Ethereum with caution, but Farrell believes that dynamic is beginning to change.\nThe crypto strategist underscored Ethereum’s potential for a “catch-up trade” against Bitcoin. \"I like the odds of ETH resuming its catch-up trade through year-end and perhaps into January,\" he said, citing strong seasonality patterns and increasing open interest in CME futures contracts.\nWhen asked what could signal a broader market top, Farrell laid out clear indicators. \"If I start to see things like stablecoin creations slow...

Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), which calls itself a bitcoin treasury company, announced yet another $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase.\nMicroStrategy shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Monday, and have gained over 527% year-to-date.\nMicroStrategy bought 15,350 bitcoins during the week ending December 15, for an average price of roughly $100,386 per bitcoin, the company reported. This purchase was financed by selling MicroStrategy shares.\nThe company now owns 439,000 bitcoins, worth approximately $47 billion at current prices. And its bet on bitcoin has had a big impact on its stock. MicroStrategy's market cap has grown from roughly $1.1 billion in August 2020 when it first adopted its bitcoin strategy to close to $100 billion now.\nThe exponential growth in MicroStrategy shares this year has been bolstered by rising bitcoin prices. Bitcoin rallied early this year due to demand from the newly launched spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), then the bitcoin halving and finally the reelection of Trump and hope of a more crypto-friendly administration.\nBut MicroStrategy shares may have more room to run. Its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index starting next week would imply many funds and ETFs—such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)—purchasing the stock to align their portfolios to the index.\nHowever, the next milestone of becoming a part of the S&P 500 index may prove to be difficult, according to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. While companies need to have a market capitalization of at least $18 billion, the S&P has complete discretion about deciding which companies make the cut.\nThe biggest issue for MicroStrategy could be its profitability. The company has not turned a profit in the past few quarters, the analysts said.\nHowever, that could change for MicroStrategy come January 2025. Current accounting rules do not allow companies like MicroStrategy to record bitcoin on their books at fair value. Instead they are forced to take an impairment loss if bitcoin prices fall while not taking any gains from rising bitcoin prices into account. Those impairments would drag down the company's profits. New rules by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) allow for capturing some of that upside from rising bitcoin prices.\nRead the original article on Investopedia","Oops, something went wrong\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) notched a fresh record high on Monday as most of the Big Tech stocks gained and bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit fresh all-time highs ahead of the Federal Reserve's final policy decision meeting this week.\nThe Nasdaq moved up 1.2%, with shares of Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Broadcom (AVGO) all closing at fresh records.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained almost 0.4%, moving closer to its own record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2% for its eighth consecutive session in the red.\nInvestors are awaiting the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year on Tuesday.

He emphasized the role of his channel as a reflection of retail interest, noting, “That’s how you know that retail’s flooding into Google, doing the searches, and then they head to YouTube.”\nNelson highlighted retail’s untapped potential in bitcoin adoption. “We’ve hardly touched retail in terms of bitcoin,” he remarked, predicting substantial growth as institutional involvement, such as ETFs and sovereign wealth funds, sets the stage for broader participation. “The retail part is going to be huge,” he added.\nPrice has made it his mission to turn retail onto bitcoin, often promoting the currency in daily interactions. However, he expressed concern about late adopters, saying, “The sad thing is most people are going to buy it when they’re forced to buy it, not when they had a chance to get it at a good price.” He also noted that retail investors might initially favor meme coins over bitcoin, despite bitcoin’s enduring value.\nWhen discussing bitcoin's price trajectory, Nelson questioned the timeline for significant growth, observing its current volatility. Price relied on technical analysis to forecast, stating, “I say five to six days of consolidation at the most. It looks to me we’re going to head to $113,000 before the end of the year.” He further projected bitcoin reaching $130,000 by Valentine’s Day.\nFundstrat analyst Sean Farrell, who nailed price calls in 2023 and is very close to his 2024 price call hitting, said Bitcoin could hit $500,000 next year if plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve pan out.\nWith billions in private equity still on the sidelines, Price believes a major influx of capital will follow once bitcoin solidifies its value above $100,000. “We still have a lot of private equity on the sidelines for whatever reason, waiting to commit larger portions of their capital,” he explained, highlighting the long-term investment approach likely to define this wave.","On Monday, Wall Street stocks edged upwards, driven by a decline in U.S. Treasury yields and investor preparations for a significant central bank meeting week.

(SMCI) shares fell as the struggling server maker is set to be removed from the Nasdaq 100.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ripped higher to close up 1.2% at a new fresh record as a handful of 'Magnificent 7' stocks also notched all-time highs.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained almost 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2%, its eighth consecutive session slide.\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), EV maker Tesla (TSLA), and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) all closed at fresh all-time highs.\nChipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) surged 11% to a new record, extending gains from last week.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly surged past $107,000 to hit a new record.\nInvestors now await the Federal Reserve's last rate policy meeting of the year, which starts on Tuesday. The markets anticipate policymakers will announce a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday afternoon.\nFour of the 'Mag Seven' stocks were on track for a record close on Monday afternoon.\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and EV maker Tesla (TSLA) rose more than 5%, while Amazon (AMZN) also touched new records.\nApple (AAPL) also hit all-time intraday highs and was headed for an all-time high close.\nHealthcare stocks declined on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants to get rid of the middleman when it comes to prescription drugs.\nCVS (CVS) declined as much as 4%. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Cigna (CI) also fell.\nThe healthcare companies own the largest PBMs, or pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and consumers. PBMs have often been accused of helping to inflate drug prices.\n“You know the middleman, right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies, and they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman,” Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\"We’re going to knock out the middleman,\" he said.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ripped higher to touch all-time intraday highs on Monday, fueled by gains in shares of Tesla (TSLA).\nThe EV giant stock soared more than 5%, sending the company's market cap valuation a stone's throw away from $1.5 trillion.\nChipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) gained more than 9% after the company's market cap surpassed $1 trillion for the first time on Friday following a bullish sales outlook driven by AI.\nMeanwhile, shares of Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) also rose more than 5% to hit fresh records.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was headed toward a record close on Monday, with a handful of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks climbing to new intraday highs while Nvidia slid.\nShares of the AI chipmaker fell roughly 2.5% in continuation of their recent downward trend.\nMeanwhile, Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and EV maker Tesla (TSLA) rose more than 4% to touch fresh record highs. Amazon (AMZN) also touched new records earlier in the session.\nApple (AAPL) also hit all-time intraday highs as the iPhone maker gained roughly 1%.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) related stocks gained on Monday as bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to new all-time highs beyond $106,800.\nThe token proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) gained more than 4% on the heels of news the software company would be included in the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). MicroStrategy has been a major buyer of bitcoin.\n\"Inclusion in Nasdaq100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, further expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program,\" wrote Bernstein analysts on Monday.\nMining stocks also rose, with MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) both gaining more than 9% and 7%, respectively.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) recaptured investor attention on Monday as the world's major cryptocurrency surged to new highs above $106,600.\nThe token traded above the $106,000 threshold around 11:00 a.m. ET after first touching fresh records late Sunday night.\nThe cryptocurrency has surged more than 50% since Donald Trump's White House win last month amid expectations of crypto-friendly policies under his administration.\nSuper Micro Computer stock (SMCI) sank as much as 14% early Monday before paring losses. The stock was down roughly 5% an hour after the market opened.\nInvestors are reacting to recent news that the company will be booted on Dec. 23 from the Nasdaq 100, along with Moderna (MRNA) and Illumina (ILMN).\nSuper Micro makes servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips for data centers, which power generative artificial intelligence software.\nThe company is facing a potential delisting from the Nasdaq Exchange due to delays in submitting its annual and quarterly filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Those delays occurred after a report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research this summer that accused Super Micro of accounting violations among other things.\nSuper Micro was recently granted an extension by the Nasdaq and must submit its filings to the SEC by Feb. 25.\nInvestors are cheering MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bet on bitcoin (BTC-USD). Its stock rose more than 3% after the software company said in an earlier filing Monday it had recently purchased another $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, meaning the company now owns 439,000 bitcoins.\nAlso on Monday, bitcoin hit a new high above $106,000. Its upswing has been fueled by the election of crypto-friendly president elect Donald Trump.\nMicroStrategy also got a boost from news last Friday that it's set to join the Nasdaq 100 on Dec. 23.\nMicroStrategy shares are now up 565% for the year, and the stock has jumped roughly 15% in the past month alone.\nMSTR will be joined by Palantir (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (AXON) on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, replacing Illumina (ILMN), Super Micro (SMCI), and Moderna (MRNA).\nUS economic output hit its highest level in nearly three years to close out 2024, according to the latest data from S&P Global.\nS&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 56.6 in December, up from 54.9 in August. Economists had expected the index to tick up to 55.1.\nIncreased activity in the services sector drove the gains, with the services PMI business activity index hitting a reading of 58.5, its highest level in 38 months. Meanwhile, manufacturing PMI declined to 48.3 in December, down from 47.9, and marking a three-month low for the index. A reading above 50 reflects expansion.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the US economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly three years in December \"consistent with GDP rising at an annualized rate of just over 3% in December.\"\n“Business is booming in the US services economy, where output is growing at the sharpest rate since the reopening of the economy from COVID lockdowns in 2021,\" Williamson said in the release.\nSam's Club is riding the dual waves of Walmart's (WMT) rise as budget-conscious consumers flock to wholesale retailers, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports.\nLed by CEO Chris Nicholas, who started in September 2023, the wholesale club founded in 1983 by Walmart founder Sam Walton has been a beneficiary of inflation-weary shoppers.\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter, same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 7%, compared to a 3.8% increase in the same time period a year ago. Through the nine months ended Oct. 31, Sam's Club has hauled in $67.2 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in operating profits.\nRead more here.\nStocks edged higher on Monday as investors turned their focus to the Federal Reserve's final rate policy meeting of the year this week and bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $104,000 per token after surging to a new record.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.3%.

Or to put that in real numbers, US$2,200,000,000,000.\nYep, that's one heck of a lot of zeros!\nIn late morning trade today, the token has retraced a touch to be trading for US$106,051.\nTwelve months ago, the Bitcoin price stood at US$41,348.\nThe token trended gradually higher for most of the year, catching tailwinds from declining interest rates in the United States and much of the developed world, as well as the launch of several US spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\nBut the biggest driver sending the token soaring to new record highs came with Donald Trump's resounding US presidential election win on 5 November.\nOn 5 November, you could have bought a whole Bitcoin for US$67,811. (You could also have bought just part of a Bitcoin, called Satoshis.) That means the Bitcoin price has gained 56% since Trump's victory.\nTrump has promised to be much more crypto-friendly than sitting President Joe Biden.\nAnd crypto investors again have the incoming US president to thank for this morning's new all-time high prices.\nIt looks like the Bitcoin price has received a big boost from speculations that Trump may follow through on his plans to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US.\nLike the nation's strategic oil reserve, this would enable the US government to tap into its Bitcoin holdings in times of national crises.\n\"We're going to do something great with crypto,\" the president said. Citing concerns of competition from China and other nations, he added, \"We want to be the head.\"\nCommenting on Bitcoin's new record, Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG, said (quoted by Reuters), \"We're in blue sky territory here. The next figure the market will be looking for is $110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didn't happen, because now we've got this news.\"\nChris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, advised caution in the wake of the record-high Bitcoin price.\nAccording to Weston:\nI think we still need to be cautious on a BTC strategic reserve and at least consider that this is not likely to happen anytime soon.\nOf course, any comment from Trump that offers an increased degree of hope that plans for a strategic reserve are evolving are an obvious tailwind, but this would come with consequences which would need to be carefully considered and well telegraphed to market players.\nMay 22, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nThe Bitcoin price just smashed through US$110,000.

What to knowThere's a higher 401(k) limit for 2025 — why you should update your account nowStudent loan forgiveness opportunities lost to those who refinance, CFPB warns\n\"The golden rule of 'never invest more than you're willing to lose' comes into play, especially when we're talking about speculative assets,\" said Boneparth, who is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.\nBefore using bitcoin profits to buy other investments, you may consider using the gains to fund another financial goal, like retiring early or buying a home, he said.\nThere's a different thought process if you want the money to stay invested, Boneparth said.\nTypically, advisors pick an asset allocation, or mix of investments, based on a client's goals, risk tolerance and timeline.\nOften, there's a \"line in the sand\" for the maximum percentages of a single asset, he said.\nTypically, Boneparth uses a maximum of 20% of a client's \"investable net worth,\" which doesn't include a home, before he starts trimming allocations of one holding.\nWhen selling crypto in a brokerage account or exchange, you could owe taxes on growth, depending on how long you've owned the asset, Boneparth said.\n\"There's no free lunch,\" he said. \"Just because it's crypto doesn't mean you're exempt from paying taxes on your gains.\"\nYou'll owe regular income taxes on profits from crypto owned for one year or less. But you'll trigger long-term capital gains — taxed at 0%, 15% or 20% — on profitable assets owned for more than one year.\nHowever, you could harvest crypto gains tax-free if you're in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket for 2024, experts say.\nFor 2024, you're eligible for the 0% rate with taxable income of $47,025 or less for single filers and $94,050 or less for married couples filing jointly. These amounts include any gains from crypto sales.\n\"That's a very effective strategy if you're in that bracket,\" Andrew Gordon, a tax attorney, certified public accountant and president of Gordon Law Group, previously told CNBC.\nThe 0% capital gains bracket may be bigger than you expect because it's based on taxable income, which you calculate by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.","Subscribe to gift this article\nGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.\nAlready a subscriber?\nThe post-Trump election crypto rally, which sparked a surge in bitcoin prices to record levels and a boom in meme coins, seems to be leaving one crypto boom fad – NFTs – in the slow lane.\nIn a bubble market in 2021-22, prices for the digital assets, known as non-fungible tokens, went through the roof.

The platform enables users to tokenize assets such as real estate, art, and commodities, thus opening up wealth creation opportunities that were previously available to few.\nThe Rexas Launchpad, its main feature, helps entrepreneurs and inventors fundraise and launch new tokens easily. Rexas Finance’s focus on democratization and innovation boosts its attractiveness and establishes a new bar for blockchain integration in real-world applications. Rexas Finance leads DeFi transformation by emphasizing value creation.\nRexas Finance’s milestones show its momentum. Since raising $25.1 million and selling over 325 million RXS tokens, the project has garnered interest from the crypto community. High-profile comments on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and a successful Certik audit have boosted investor confidence in the token’s authenticity and long-term potential. \nRexas Finance’s $1 million giveaway will give twenty winners $50,000 in RXS tokens to join its growing community. This ambitious promotional strategy shows the project’s compassion and dedication to attracting devoted users. The shift in global crypto dynamics coupled with the shifting fundamentals of the RXS token could positively impact Rexas Finance, making it a market leader in 2025. \n\n\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\nEven in tough times, Shiba Inu (SHIB) survives in the crypto pool when most cryptocurrency assets often prevail with skepticism. After the dip, the avatar token rose to roughly $0.00003 within 24 hours from its subscriber-raising peak of $0.00009. With trade volume rising to $1.76 billion, SHIB targets $0.00003200, with analysts forecasting a breakthrough past $0.00003300. This price trajectory shows the market’s trust in SHIB, driven by its dynamic community, rising usefulness, and strategic developments that continue to attract retail and institutional investors.  Recent whale activity and burn rates have strengthened SHIB’s growth potential. Major players’ faith in SHIB’s long-term potential is shown by whale purchases like 114.5 billion SHIB for roughly $4 million. Over 52 million SHIB were burned in the preceding 24 hours, a 12,670% increase. Burns reduce token supply, increasing scarcity and value. With its comprehensive ecosystem projects, such as the ShibaSwap platform and the future Shibarium layer-2 solution, SHIB is prepared to capitalize on the next bull run, making it one of the most intriguing tokens to watch for massive profits in 2025.\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nDogecoin (DOGE), the first memecoin, keeps holding a special place in the community’s hearts thanks to its passion and impressive staying power, even when the markets are unfavorable. DOGE settled between $0.35 and $0.48 after a 208% breakout in early November. \nThis steadiness has sparked curiosity about its next move, but signals point to an ascent. “Trader Tardigrade,” a respected analyst, believes DOGE’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) reset signals a bullish surge. Historical patterns show that RSI resets generally precede large price increases, making DOGE a promising 2025 investment. \nSantiment’s data shows a 31% decline in DOGE’s “mean dollar invested age” over eight weeks, indicating renewed retail and institutional investor interest necessary for explosive price action.\nHowever, market observer “DonAlt” sees the $0.50 resistance level as a major obstacle that requires a big trigger. Despite this, a short-term liquidity collection fall to $0.32–$0.34 could boost the rebound. \n\n\n\nThese retracements remove weak players and establish the foundation for a sustainable upward trend. Dogecoin’s “king of meme coins” status could grow in 2025 with a dedicated community, improved payment infrastructure, and incorporation into high-profile sites. \nDOGE will likely remain a market favorite with strong technical indications and rising investor confidence, perhaps offering unmatched returns for those betting on its next breakout.\nConclusion \nShiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the cryptocurrency market’s top competitors for exponential development in 2025. Each coin has its merits, from SHIB’s strong ecology and burn mechanisms to DOGE’s committed community and promising technical indications. Rexas Finance is disrupting blockchain with its real-world asset tokenization and DeFi integration.

Rexas Finance’s focus on democratization and innovation boosts its attractiveness and establishes a new bar for blockchain integration in real-world applications. Rexas Finance leads DeFi transformation by emphasizing value creation.\nRexas Finance’s milestones show its momentum. Since raising $25.1 million and selling over 325 million RXS tokens, the project has garnered interest from the crypto community. High-profile comments on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and a successful Certik audit have boosted investor confidence in the token’s authenticity and long-term potential. \nRexas Finance’s $1 million giveaway will give twenty winners $50,000 in RXS tokens to join its growing community.

The shift in global crypto dynamics coupled with the shifting fundamentals of the RXS token could positively impact Rexas Finance, making it a market leader in 2025. \n\n\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\nEven in tough times, Shiba Inu (SHIB) survives in the crypto pool when most cryptocurrency assets often prevail with skepticism. After the dip, the avatar token rose to roughly $0.00003 within 24 hours from its subscriber-raising peak of $0.00009. With trade volume rising to $1.76 billion, SHIB targets $0.00003200, with analysts forecasting a breakthrough past $0.00003300. This price trajectory shows the market’s trust in SHIB, driven by its dynamic community, rising usefulness, and strategic developments that continue to attract retail and institutional investors.  Recent whale activity and burn rates have strengthened SHIB’s growth potential. Major players’ faith in SHIB’s long-term potential is shown by whale purchases like 114.5 billion SHIB for roughly $4 million. Over 52 million SHIB were burned in the preceding 24 hours, a 12,670% increase. Burns reduce token supply, increasing scarcity and value. With its comprehensive ecosystem projects, such as the ShibaSwap platform and the future Shibarium layer-2 solution, SHIB is prepared to capitalize on the next bull run, making it one of the most intriguing tokens to watch for massive profits in 2025.\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nDogecoin (DOGE), the first memecoin, keeps holding a special place in the community’s hearts thanks to its passion and impressive staying power, even when the markets are unfavorable. DOGE settled between $0.35 and $0.48 after a 208% breakout in early November. \nThis steadiness has sparked curiosity about its next move, but signals point to an ascent. “Trader Tardigrade,” a respected analyst, believes DOGE’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) reset signals a bullish surge. Historical patterns show that RSI resets generally precede large price increases, making DOGE a promising 2025 investment. \nSantiment’s data shows a 31% decline in DOGE’s “mean dollar invested age” over eight weeks, indicating renewed retail and institutional investor interest necessary for explosive price action.\nHowever, market observer “DonAlt” sees the $0.50 resistance level as a major obstacle that requires a big trigger. Despite this, a short-term liquidity collection fall to $0.32–$0.34 could boost the rebound. \n\n\n\nThese retracements remove weak players and establish the foundation for a sustainable upward trend. Dogecoin’s “king of meme coins” status could grow in 2025 with a dedicated community, improved payment infrastructure, and incorporation into high-profile sites. \nDOGE will likely remain a market favorite with strong technical indications and rising investor confidence, perhaps offering unmatched returns for those betting on its next breakout.\nConclusion \nShiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the cryptocurrency market’s top competitors for exponential development in 2025.

All rights reserved.","President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run NASA, Jared Isaacman, is a 41-year-old space enthusiast, who just months ago commanded the world's first all-civilian mission to reach orbit.\nHe's also a fintech billionaire.\nIsaacman is the founder of Shift4, a fintech company that provides secure payment processing solutions for businesses. The company's stock price has jumped almost 40% this year, lifting its market cap to $9.3 billion. Isaacman started the business in 1999 at age 16 and took it public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020.\nIn a Dec. 4 post on his Truth Social platform announcing the choice, Trump wrote, \"Jared has demonstrated exceptional leadership, building a trailblazing global financial technology company.\"\nThat success can be traced in part to a series of bold bets and a recent acquisition spree, including spending tens of millions of dollars to buy a crypto-focused business almost three years ago.\nInside Isaacman's New York residence near Central Park, around a lofted conference room with glass walls that sits above the apartment's living area, Isaacman and members of his executive team sat with Alex Wilson and Pat Duffy, two entrepreneurs who were in the final stages of selling their crypto donation marketplace to Shift4. It was early 2022.\nWith a whiteboard behind them, they spitballed on how blockchain-based technology could be applied across the payment company's business.\nBitcoin had hit a record a few months earlier, jumping sixfold from the end of 2019 through the close of 2021. A range of digital tokens were delivering outsized returns. The market was frothy, spirits were high and meme coins were in their prime.\nBut while Elon Musk was touting dogecoin and money was pouring into nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, Wilson, Duffy and Isaacman were focused on a far less glitzy corner of the digital asset world: stablecoins.\nStablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies matched to the value of a real-world asset and are virtually synonymous with U.S. dollar-pegged tokens. Today, they're collectively worth around $200 billion and are often used to move money across borders at a fraction of the cost of legacy payment systems.\nWilson, 31, said the group around the table at Isaacman's house \"all agreed it was more likely that stablecoins would become a regular medium of exchange than bitcoin or ethereum.\" They wanted to build products that took advantage of blockchain but were token agnostic.\n\"We wanted to meet users where they were and equip our merchants to take payments in whatever ways their customers wanted to pay,\" Wilson said.\nIn front of the whiteboard with marker in hand, Isaacman walked through ways crypto could be applied to the broader Shift4 business. Wilson said Isaacman has an uncanny ability to get in the weeds despite being the CEO of a company that now has more than 3,000 employees.\nWeeks later, on March 1, Shift4 announced it had purchased The Giving Block, Wilson and Duffy's company, and would pursue a \"$45+ billion embedded cross-sell opportunity by bundling crypto donation capabilities with traditional card acceptance.\" Shift4 paid $54 million and included in the deal a potential earnout of up to $246 million.\nDuffy and Wilson are now helming Shift4's crypto team. While the acquisition was in 2022, the company's push into crypto began in earnest in October 2024, when the company announced a Pay with Crypto service. It's being rolled out to all 200,000 of the platform's merchants, making it possible to spend crypto at hotels, restaurants and stadiums.\n\"It's the biggest step toward crypto payments becoming mainstream that the industry has ever had,\" Wilson said.\nIsaacman told CNBC in a statement he's excited to see the original vision he discussed with Wilson and Duffy during the acquisition process \"come to life at a time when crypto is becoming increasingly mainstream and gathering real momentum.\"\nIsaacman finds himself at the center of the action.\nThe crypto market, which was already red hot, has been on a more dramatic upswing since Trump's election win in November, which came alongside congressional victories for pro-crypto candidates. Bitcoin topped $108,000 on Tuesday for the first time, up more than 55% since election night, and the overall market cap of tokens has soared past $3.7 trillion.\nMore institutions and retail investors have also been jumping in, thanks to the flood of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that hit the market starting in January along with other options products that offer a new way to bet on the future price of bitcoin.\nStablecoins have moved closer to the mainstream as well.\nIn October, Stripe agreed to pay $1.1 billion for Bridge Network, a stablecoin platform that's trying to make it easy for businesses to transact using digital currencies. The deal was a big wake-up call for traditional credit card companies.\nVisa and Mastercard currently dominate U.S. payments, accounting for 80% of all credit card volume in the U.S., according to data from the Nilson Report. Credit card networks charge a transaction fee to a payment processor like Stripe for using their so-called rails. The costs, which include a flat fee plus a percentage of each payment that can be up to 3.30% for American Express, generally get passed along to the customer.\nBut with stablecoins, transactions can cost less than a penny and are virtually instantaneous. Emily Sands, the technical lead for Stripe's data science team, says stablecoins are great for cross-border transactions, which are important to almost all of the company's users.\n\"That's really valuable to the Stripe ecosystem,\" said Sands. \"It's not just for the cards network. It's not just for the local payment methods. It can also be for crypto.\"\nBlockchain-based payments company Ripple just launched its own stablecoin, RLUSD, and crypto custodian BitGo plans to follow. Robinhood and U.K. fintech Revolut are reportedly considering similar moves.\nPayPal was relatively early to the market, launching a U.S. dollar-pegged coin called PYUSD in August 2023. PYUSD topped $1 billion in market cap this summer but has since fallen below $500 million as competition for market share heats up.\nTether's USDT and Circle's USDC are the dominant stablecoins, with $140 billion and $42 billion worth of coins in supply, respectively, accounting for about 90% of the market combined.\nGiven their growing popularity, experts are eagerly waiting to see how the big credit card companies respond and whether they come out with their own coins.\nIn October, Visa announced the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) to make it easier for banks to launch their own stablecoins. Cuy Sheffield, Visa's head of crypto, said the offering allows banks to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens.\nVisa is \"powering a lot of these capabilities for them,\" Sheffield said.\nIn July of last year, Mastercard unveiled its Multi-Token Network (MTN), which facilitates payments of fully collateralized stablecoins as well as other digital assets over the platform.\nRaj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's head of crypto and blockchain, told CNBC that MTN is looking to bring crypto capabilities, including the programmability of digital money, to banks, which hold trillions of dollars worth of dollar deposits.\nBut stablecoin issuers have had their share of challenges. TerraUSD, or UST, and sister token luna collapsed during the crypto meltdown of 2022, wiping out billions of dollars in value and eroding confidence in the reserves backing certain stablecoins.\nMore recently, The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the Department of Justice is looking into Tether for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules. A Tether spokesperson said at the time that the story was \"based on pure rank speculation\" and that it has \"no knowledge of any such investigations.\"\nWith more established financial players getting involved, the market is gaining broader credibility.\nAri Redbord, global head of policy at blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs, said stablecoins are the bridge between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial system.\n\"That's why you see the leading fintechs — Stripe, PayPal, Visa and others — really leaning into the use of stablecoins,\" Redbord said.\nThe crypto industry has lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill for years on stablecoin legislation that would offer safeguards for these dollarized digital assets and the companies issuing them. Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, one of the industry's loudest voices in Washington, told CNBC in September that the company has seen a lot of traction with stablecoins.\n\"Crypto started off as really focused on trading, and it's now made a big shift toward utility, specifically payments,\" said Armstrong. He said stablecoin volume reached $10 trillion last year, and that could double or triple this year, \"so it's been a huge growth story for crypto as people start to think about how to make the dollar faster, cheaper and more global.\"\nAt Shift4, growth has continued through acquisition. The company bought German point-of-sale company Vectron Systems, Card Industry Professionals in the U.K., Canada's Eigen Payments and other payment firms in recent years.\nWilson said the company views stablecoins in the context of two different target markets. One group consists of people who have gotten rich in crypto and want to use their tokenized dollars \"to charter a jet or helicopter,\" he said. The other includes those who live in Latin America and Africa, \"where people just want to spend stablecoins for daily payments because Visa and Mastercard adoption is low,\" he said.\nA survey conducted by Castle Island Ventures, Visa and other partners showed that stablecoins are a critical piece of economies in emerging markets like Nigeria. In countries \"facing severe liquidity crunches,\" stablecoins \"allow individuals and businesses to access international USD payments without hard currency having to leave the country,\" the report said.\nStandard Chartered wrote in a recent report that stablecoins are currently equivalent in size to 1% of financial transactions in the U.S. and a similar percentage of foreign exchange transactions. As they gain legitimacy, a move to 10% is \"feasible,\" the bank said.\nAs Shift4 tries to position itself at the forefront of what it hopes to be a continued wave of stablecoin momentum, Isaacman is off to the public sector.\nIn addition to his career in finance, Isaacman has led two private spaceflights through SpaceX, in 2021 and 2024, commanding crews on multiday trips around the Earth. His spaceflight ambitions have fostered an increasingly close relationship with SpaceX CEO Musk, who became one of Trump's biggest backers and is poised to have an outsized role in the administration.\nOn Dec. 4, Isaacman wrote a letter addressed to his \"Shift4 Family,\" telling investors and employees that until his appointment is confirmed by the Senate, he will remain as CEO.\n\"Shift4 has been my life's work since I was 16 years old,\" wrote Isaacman, who dropped out of school and built the company from his parents' basement. \"But it is my time to serve and give back to the nation that enabled me to live the American dream.\"\nIsaacman said his choice to lead NASA \"reflects my passion for advancing humankind's reach among the stars, unlocking the secrets of the universe, and improving life on Earth along the way.\"\nWilson recalled a dinner with Issacman in March 2022 after The Giving Block transaction closed. They were in Las Vegas, and Isaacman brought Wilson and Duffy to an Italian restaurant called Lago at the Bellagio on the eve of the announcement. Wilson remembers discussing what it was like when Isaacman started his business as a teenager.\n\"No one cares more and works harder than the founder, and it really shows with Jared,\" Wilson said.\nWATCH: The first-ever private spacewalk with Polaris Dawn Mission Commander Jared Isaacman","18th Dec, 2024. 03:55 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on May 25, 2025\nAs of Dec 18, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $104576.99.

Meanwhile, funds trading commodities and equities ranked second and third.\nJordan Brooks, co-head of the Macro Strategies Group at investment management firm AQR agreed that sovereign bonds were becoming less of a key investment theme.\n“Inflation is now more balanced. From here, we think things are less certain across the board,” said Brooks, adding that the $7.5 trillion a day currencies market would be in focus.\nAlthough Trump has embraced digital assets, promising friendly regulation and to accumulate a stockpile of bitcoin , some hedge fund investors are not convinced.\n“We haven’t seen a lot of institutional investor demand on the solutions side for crypto trading strategies,” said Carol Ward, head of solutions at the $175 billion Man Group.\nBenjamin Low, a senior investment director at Cambridge Associates, said some Asia-based funds had explored small-scaled crypto investing, but nothing had come of it yet.\nCrypto might serve as a good diversifier that trades differently to broader markets, said Low, whose advisory firm links hedge funds with investors and undertakes fund manager selection and allocation for clients.\n“But the volatility is so high, when you talk crypto, what are you trading, is it just the cryptocurrencies, are you buying into companies or equities?” said Low.\n“The definition is so broad and wide that it might invite more questions from existing investors,” he added.\nNevertheless, attitudes are changing and many funds have updated their investor documents in the last couple of years to allow them to include crypto exposure, said Edo Rulli, CIO of hedge fund solutions at UBS Asset Management.\n“Larger exposures in non-specialist hedge funds are not there yet. Digital asset exchanges are not regulated and some carry reputational and fraud risk,” said Rulli, adding that some hedge funds have found ways to trade crypto indirectly.\nNextGen Digital Venture, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund specializing in crypto stocks, jumped 116% this year through November, thanks to its exposure to stocks like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Marathon Digital Holdings.\nFounder Jason Huang is preparing his second crypto-focused fund and while optimistic, cautioned that bitcoin could reach a cyclical peak next year.\nMeanwhile, hedge funds including Millennium Management, Capula Management and Tudor Investment raised their exposure to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in the third quarter, filings showed.\nAnd multi-strategy funds have bought the convertible bonds of software company MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, whose shares have soared nearly 500% this year.\nSkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci said it should take a while for crypto to lure more big allocators, as potential regulatory discussions have just started.\n“We’re creating now a regulatory runway. Big institutions, endowments, big enterprises, they don’t want to get fired. They’re sitting on top of piles of money, and it’s their job to take measured risk,” he said.\nBe smart with your money.

This is an interesting new crypto startup, founded by three former executives at Revolut, the London-based fintech juggernaut.\nPhuc To was the global head of product for Revolut, and was in charge of the company’s crypto project back in 2021. Mikael Peydayesh was the head of core payments at Revolut, and later became the head of premium plans, and Arthur Johanet was the head of card payments for a while before he went on to lead Revolut’s cryptocurrency department.\nWhile crypto exchanges have greatly simplified the onboarding experience for new users over the years, the three believed it could still be improved, and so they teamed up to create a new app that makes cryptocurrencies more accessible.\nNeverless lets you buy over 400 crypto tokens from the app using Apple Pay or Google Pay. In addition to the most common cryptocurrencies, the startup has chosen to offer access to meme coins and relatively rare coins with low trading volumes.\nBuying these small-cap tokens can be challenging, as you usually need to find a crypto exchange that lists them. Alternatively, you can swap tokens on a decentralized exchange, which can be complicated if you don’t understand how decentralized applications (dApps) work.\nMoreover, there are some caveats when you’re trying to buy tokens with low trading volumes. Pricing can vary from one trading venue to another, and there can be a large spread between the buying and selling prices. Neverless says it can seamlessly route trades to the right trading platform to get its users the best prices.\nAnother issue regular people have with crypto trading products are the fees involved. While tech-savvy people often look at the fine print before buying crypto, and are willing to create yet another account, big exchanges often take advantage of their clout to charge higher fees if you just want to instantly buy and sell crypto without creating a market order.\nNeverless doesn’t charge fees to buy and sell cryptos using bank transfers, blockchain transfers, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. For transactions above $1,000 with Apple Pay or Google Pay, the startup charges a 1% fee. Of course, things could change in the future as Neverless becomes more popular.\nSo how does the startup make money right now? On some cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL, XRP, and AVAX), Neverless generates interest that is passed on to the users. The company also offers automated trading strategies that revolve around high-frequency arbitrage and market-making. Neverless can take a share of the returns generated from these yield-generating products.\nThe company has secured a MiFID license, which means that it is a regulated financial firm in Europe. It will have to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation when it comes into force in the coming weeks.\nEarlier this year, the startup raised $6.7 million in a seed round led by Lakestar and Connect Ventures. Nordstar, Chad West, Dan Westgarth, Eamon Jubbawy, Xiao-Xiao, and David Chreng also invested in the round.\nTopics\nSenior Reporter\nLIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

Inconsistencies may occur.\nInvestors are suing people associated with a cryptocurrency launched by Hawk Tuah Girl Hailey Welch, following the crash of the memecoin named after her.\nIt lost more than 95 percent of its value in a single day when it was released on December 4. Lawyers for the investors wrote in their December 19 court filing that the lawsuit \"arises from the unlawful promotion and sale of the Hawk Tuah cryptocurrency memecoin, known as the \"$HAWK\" token (the \"Token\" or \"$HAWK\"), which Defendants offered and sold to the public without proper registration.\"\nNamed in the suit are: Tuah The Moon Foundation, which was used to handle money taken in from the sale of the meme coin, and the coin's creator, OverHere Ltd and its executive, Clinton So and the meme coin's Los Angeles-based promoter, Alex Larson Schultz.\nNewsweek sought email comment on Thursday from Welch; Tuah The Moon and OverHere Ltd.\nWelch rose to fame after she was filmed by YouTube creators using the onomatopoeic phrase \"hawk tuah\" to describe a spitting action in a sexual context. She has since transformed her newfound fame into a successful merchandise line and a podcast, Talk Tuah, which has featured business people such as Mark Cuban.\nThe plaintiff attorneys say in their filing: \"Through aggressive promotional campaigns and promises of future growth, Defendants created a speculative frenzy that caused the Token's market value to spike shortly after launch, reaching a significant market capitalization. Defendants leveraged Welch's celebrity status and connections to enhance the Token's credibility and appeal, including discussing the $HAWK project during Welch's podcasts featuring notable guests.\"\nA memecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is typically launched on the back of a popular internet meme or recurring joke. Welch is not named as a defendant in the case, which was launched in federal court in the eastern district of New York.\nLawyers for the investors also state in their filing: \"Defendants leveraged the extensive social media following of Hailey Welch, a prominent social media personality known as the \"Hawk Tuah Girl,\" to market the Token as a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project.\n\"Many of the investors were first-time cryptocurrency participants drawn to the project through Welch's involvement.\n\"The rapid decline in the Token's value caused substantial damages to investors who relied on Welch's participation and the project's stated road map.\"\nThe plaintiffs are represented by several lawyers from the Wolf Popper law firm and Max Burwick from the Burwick law firm. Newsweek sought comment on Thursday.\nWhat People Are Saying\nOn December 4, Welch told Fortune that her memecoin, is \"not just a cash grab\" as its value plunged $440 million in just 20 minutes.\nWelch said she had changed her mind about crypto after attending conferences and realized that it was a \"good way to interact with my fans.\"\nAt the time, her manager, Jonnie Forster, clarified that the HAWK token is distinct from other celebrity crypto ventures, as they are not encouraging people to purchase it.\nInstead, they planned to distribute free tokens to social media followers and fans who have purchased her merchandise. Forster mentioned that Welch will own 10 percent of the supply, but she will be unable to sell any of it for a year.\nThe defendants will be given an opportunity to replay to the lawsuit and will likely seek a summary judgment in their favor. If the judge does not grant summary judgment, pretrial motions will begin. Plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and, if granted, a jury would decide damages if the lawsuit is successful.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\nSean O'Driscoll is a Newsweek Senior Crime and Courts Reporter based in Ireland.

That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.\"\nOverall, the global crypto market cap dipped by 1.2%, reaching $3.52 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\nEthereum, the world’s second-largest digital asset, also dropped by 10%, though it recovered Friday morning by reaching a price near $3,467. Meanwhile, Solana, the world’s sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $92 billion, is currently trading at $192 at the time of writing, after dropping 10%.\nOn Thursday, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which debuted this January, saw their first outflows in weeks, with bitcoin ETFs seeing $650 million in outflows. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs saw outflows exceeding $60 million.\nWith the upcoming holiday season on the horizon, some market analysts underlined that \"mixed behavior\" over Christmas and New Year was to be expected: \"The first rule of bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet,\" said James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet. \"It’s behavior is always mixed and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year going into the next. Sometimes the price rises in the new year and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year.\"\n\"While reduced liquidity can heighten volatility, the absence of major institutional activity may actually stabilize prices,\" Toledano added. \"Notable exceptions include years when macroeconomic news or market catalysts spark sudden moves. This year, much depends on investor sentiment following 2024’s [exchange-traded fund] approval and the Trump-factor as well as other macro trends. A relatively quiet period is possible unless unexpected news reignites volatility. But given that on January 20th, pro-bitcoin Trump will be back in the White House, I think we can expect a lot of price movement again very soon,\" he said.","The bitcoin price is recovering somewhat after a mild print of the Federal Reserve's key inflation rate.

Bitcoin has slumped more than 10% since the start of the week, when it hit highs of more than $106,000.\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by volume, was down 12% to $3,237.77. Other major digital assets, including Solana and Cardano, similarly saw double-digit declines in value over the last 24 hours.\nThe losses come after the Fed’s third and final interest rate cut of the year. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate by a quarter point, to between 4.25% and 4.50%.\nWhile lower interest rates tends to favor markets, even cryptocurrencies, because they improve investors’ appetite for risk and create excess capital used for investments, Bitcoin has taken a hit this week.\nThat’s because the central bank returned its focus to concerns about inflation, which is still running hotter than the Fed had hoped for just a few months ago. The Fed indicated in its updated Summary of Economic Projections on Wednesday that, given quarter-point cuts, it could carry out just two reductions of the federal funds rate in 2025. That’s half the number it had previously expected.\n“With today’s action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a new conference Wednesday. “We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.”\nCentral bankers also raised their inflation forecasts as year-end 2024 expectations have, in Powell’s words, “kind of fallen apart.” The Fed is now projecting headline inflation of 2.4%, a slight increase from 2.3% anticipated in September, and core inflation of 2.8%, up from 2.6%. The Fed also raised its 2024 GDP growth projection to 2.5%.\nWhile Bitcoin has historically fared well against inflation, economic uncertainty and resurgent inflation fears can drive investors away from riskier assets and toward safer bets such as Treasury notes.\nIn his news conference, Powell also cast doubt on the feasibility of President-elect Donald Trump’s vows to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve.\n“We are not allowed to own Bitcoin,” he told reporters. “The Federal Reserve says what we can own and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.”\nTrump embraced cryptocurrencies during his campaign, pitching himself as the “crypto candidate” and “crypto president” while courting tech leaders.\nIn addition to promising a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, Trump has called for all Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S., and attached his name to multiple crypto projects throughout the year.\nTrump has tapped Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, to replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins, who now leads the consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, has chaired The Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, which was charged with advocating best practices and recommending legal frameworks that promote the crypto industry.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","20th Dec, 2024. 04:39 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on May 28, 2025\nAs of Dec 20, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $92991.04.

For good reason, the ETFs are widely seen as one of the primary catalysts behind Bitcoin's triple-digit percentage gains this year. Tens of billions of dollars have flowed into these spot Bitcoin ETFs, and that has helped to push up the price of Bitcoin throughout the year.\nBut Bitcoin is no longer the only cryptocurrency with a spot ETF. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) joined the ETF party in July, and speculation is mounting over which cryptocurrency could be next in 2025. The three on my radar right now are Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). If any of them receive spot ETF approval in 2025, they could be off to the races.\nMy top pick is Solana, which now ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap of about $100 billion. Solana is up about 90% this year (as of Dec. 18), after turning in a blistering 900% return in 2023.\nSome investors view Solana as the next Ethereum, which is why its price has soared duting the past two years. Just like Ethereum, Solana is a smart contract blockchain network. Thus, anything Ethereum can do, Solana can also do. But Solana is considerably faster, cheaper, and easier to use than Ethereum, which is why top investors such as Cathie Wood of Ark Invest are so bullish on Solana.\nIn terms of Solana getting an ETF in 2025, it's worth paying attention to what's happening in the rest of the world. In Brazil, for example, regulators recently signed off on spot Solana ETFs. And eight different Solana exchange-traded products (ETPs) currently trade within Europe. That's more than for any other cryptocurrency, with the exception of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nSeveral prominent investment firms have already filed spot Solana ETF applications in the U.S. So official Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval could come as soon as the first quarter of 2025, when the new Trump administration comes into office.\nMy second pick is XRP, which has been absolutely on fire ever since the presidential election. XRP was trading around $0.50 on Election Day, and nearly hit $3 before a recent pullback. For the year, XRP is up a hefty 145%.\nLike Solana, XRP is often cited as a potential spot ETF prospect, and several different investment firms have already filed for spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. And, as is the case with Solana, XRP investment products already trade elsewhere in the world. In Europe, for example, there are three different XRP ETPs.\nBut there's more to XRP than just the ETF narrative. More so than any other cryptocurrency, XRP has benefited from the so-called Trump trade. This is essentially a bet that the pro-crypto optimism surrounding the Trump administration will lead to a rising tide for all cryptos.\nThis rising-tide effect is especially important for XRP, which has been embroiled in regulatory controversy since December 2020. That's when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. The growing consensus now is that the SEC will abandon this lawsuit in 2025, freeing Ripple to go back to business as usual. And a pro-crypto environment in Washington, D.C., could grease the skids for any applications that might require SEC approval -- such as a spot ETF application.\nLast up is Cardano, which has soared in value after the election to break through the $1 mark. Cardano is now up 55% for the year. That's the same as Ethereum but nowhere near Bitcoin (up 105%), which is why Cardano has flown under the radar of many investors.\nLike Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract blockchain network. And, just like Solana, Cardano is a potential Ethereum killer. Cardano currently has a $36 billion market cap, which ranks No. 9 among all cryptocurrencies. Cardano is a cryptocurrency with a track record dating back nearly a decade, and a very loyal blockchain developer ecosystem, so it likely has long-term staying power.\nThe current thinking is that Cardano could triple in value to hit a price of $3, if a new spot ETF is approved in 2025. That would match its all-time high from three years ago, when Cardano traded for $3.10.\nOf these three cryptocurrencies, I think Solana has the best chance of skyrocketing in value next year. It has less regulatory risk than XRP, and has more upside potential than Cardano. And, based on Solana ETF approvals happening elsewhere in the world, Solana appears to have the highest likelihood of getting U.S. approval for a spot ETF product.\nSo, yes, Bitcoin is great. But there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies worth considering. The ETF investment thesis is a very powerful one, and being able to find the next crypto to get a spot ETF could be one way to boost your investment performance next year.\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Solana wasn’t one of them.

FBS analysts explore how pivotal events have shaped the digital finance landscape and identify emerging opportunities for the coming year.\nA Closer Look at 2024\nAccording to FBS analysts, 2024 was shaped by transformative events that drove significant growth in the crypto market. Bitcoin led the charge, gaining over 146% following its halving event. Ethereum also thrived as institutional investments surged after ETF approvals, underscoring its expanding role in the global financial system.\nU.S. cryptocurrency policies under Donald Trump’s administration were another major factor in 2024's growth. Initiatives such as exploring Bitcoin for debt reduction bolstered market sentiment, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 milestone and driving broader adoption.\nThe year also saw the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), a trend highlighted by FBS analysts as pivotal in revolutionizing traditional asset management. By making illiquid assets more accessible, tokenization is redefining investment landscapes across industries such as real estate and commodities.\n2025: What Lies Ahead?\nFBS analysts forecast that Bitcoin’s momentum will continue, with a potential price target of $250,000 by year-end. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is expected to surpass $3.4 trillion, supported by the rapid rise of altcoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).\nEthereum’s position is set to strengthen further, with FBS anticipating new ETF approvals for altcoins like Solana and XRP.

The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nANDY MILLS (AM): Given the stellar market performance this year, how do things bode for 2025?\nJASON TRENNERT (JT): The good news from an economic perspective is that I would say the chances of a recession next year are quite low. Labor markets are tight, corporate profits seem strong, credit spreads are tight. So all those things are good. In terms of the market perspective, I would say this year is gonna be a tough act to follow in 2025, and that’s simply because you’re starting at very rich multiples. And I would say it’s probably pretty difficult at this point to really see big multiple expansion based on lower long-term interest rates or, or even significantly lower short-term interest rates. So I have a feeling that market performance will be more in line with what profits do and, and we’re expecting profits to be up about 9% next year. So that’s kind of our, our, that’s where we’re starting our, our base case.\nAM: So given the low risk of recession, what’s your biggest fear for 2025?\nJT: My biggest fear really for 2025, and it’s part and parcel of some of the structural changes we’ve seen in the economy, is that there is a chance, and this was true regardless of who won, of a second wave of inflation and that’s partly because what we found is that historically, once you have one wave of inflation, the chances of getting a second wave were about nine in 10. It’s also because in the first wave of inflation, workers tend to get left behind. And so their demand for higher wages continues well after the first wave of inflation.\nAM: And we’re seeing that right now.\nJT: Well, so you see Boeing machinists are getting 38% over four years or long shoremen are getting 62% over six years. That’s an indication that their standard of living probably deteriorated over the last four years and the companies need to make up for that. So that makes it difficult. If your target is 2% inflation, it’s hard to do that when big parts of the population are getting big pay increases. And then of course we have massive deficits, which are running deficits of 6-to-7% of GDP when you’re at full employment, which is extremely unusual. So that’s important because if we don’t get, if we do have another wave of inflation that could lead to significantly higher long-term interest rates. And what we found, at least for the stock market, once interest rates get close to 5% on the 10-year treasury, that’s really when the stock market has a lot of trouble. Right now we’re probably around 4.50, something along those lines. It’s manageable. At 5% I think it gets a little bit harder to be an equity investor.\nAM: A lot to keep our eye on for 2025. Bitcoin’s had an amazing year, especially post-election. People believe that Trump is going to be pro-Bitcoin. Do you see Bitcoin’s price continuing to go up and up and up in 2025?\nJT: Not at the pace at which it’s caught up. In my opinion the reason why we’ve seen a big increase in the value of Bitcoin since the election is that the regulatory risks are greatly diminished. So it’s very unlikely it’s going to be outlawed or made very difficult to purchase. So more people will be able to purchase it. The bad thing, in my opinion, but I think it’s good for the country, is that the dollar is likely to be quite a bit stronger, in my opinion, if the Trump administration is successful, particularly when it comes to things like the Department of Government Efficiency. If it’s good at bringing down the deficit, those are things that will strengthen the dollar versus other fiat currencies. There won’t be as much need or interest over the longer term in alternative currencies like Bitcoin. And so theoretically Bitcoin and gold should move roughly the same. And I know they’re probably younger people that think that’s crazy, but in my opinion, gold has a 5,000 year brand of guarding against inflation and Bitcoin has like a 15 year brand. Both have done a pretty decent job, but there are a lot of people around the world that don’t have access to be able to buy Bitcoin. It’s a little bit harder. So I don’t foresee this type of price appreciation continuing. And in some ways if you really, I mean it’s one thing if you just make money through speculation, you want that. But as an American, you probably don’t want Bitcoin to be going up this rapidly because it suggests bad things about the fiscal situation in the United States and the value of the US dollar.\nAM: Gold versus Bitcoin. Which one are you putting your money in?\nJT: I’m more in gold right now and I will say I own it and so I don’t own Bitcoin much to my dismay. I wish I did, obviously. But I probably will buy some. We should have some if I’m in this business. I am long gold, but I’m less excited about it than I was before the election to be candid because I do see the physical, fiat currency of the US dollar doing a bit better.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","23rd Dec, 2024. 04:49 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 8, 2024\nAs of Dec 23, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $95863.42.

That’s roughly how much the aggregate market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is down from last Monday’s record $3.9 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin accounts for about 56% of the overall crypto market with a market cap of $1.9 trillion.\nThe recent selloff coincides with losses across risk-forward financial assets, including stocks, as the S&P 500 is down 2% over the last week. Catalyzing the declines was Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, in which the U.S. central bank indicated more heightened concerns about lingering inflation and forecasted fewer 2025 interest rate cuts than previously projected. That’s bad news for riskier assets, like crypto, as investors tend to keep money in high-returning, low-risk government bonds when interest rates are higher.  “Monetary easing has almost always favored the price of bitcoin, and the opposite has a negative impact on the price,” Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange bitbank, wrote in emailed comments Monday.\nEyebrow-raising corrections are also very common for bitcoin, which endured a more than 20% selloff this summer and a more than 70% one from 2021 to 2022 prior to its all-time high set this month. Bitcoin remains up massively in 2024, gaining 120% year-to-date, up 36% since the election, which returned newfound crypto bull Donald Trump to Washington. Other assets which surged have similarly taken a breather, including Tesla stock, which is down 12% from its record high set last week but trades more than 70% higher than it did prior to the election.","Oops, something went wrong\nThe price of the popular meme coin Dogecoin has slid to $0.31, representing a decline of nearly a quarter of its value compared to last week.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dropped to a price of around $95,000 on Sunday, after reaching a new all-time high of $108,000 last week.\nRecently, Dogecoin plummeted to its worst price in over a month on Friday, reaching a low of $0.267. However, the meme coin is still seeing a 233% growth over the last 12 months.\nWith the announcement of Dogecoin booster Elon Musk’s appointment to the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” – famously abbreviated “DOGE” – there is speculation that the meme coin may enjoy spectacular growth during a Donald Trump presidency.\nMeme coins, in general, have seen a marked upsurge in value since Trump’s November victory. The market capitalization for meme coins reached more than $66 billion since November 6, representing its highest level in seven months.\n“Meme coins are the sugar rush of the crypto world — fun, flashy, and easy to digest, but they’re not exactly the healthiest long-term play,\" Ben Kurland from DYOR Labs recently told TheStreet Crypto. \"That said, they serve an important role as a gateway for younger investors.”\n“The challenge is turning those first-time dabblers into educated participants who graduate from meme coins to projects with real utility,\" Kurland added. \"Meme coins might bring people to the table, but it’s up to the broader crypto community to keep them engaged.\"\n\"Meme coins and community-driven projects will likely thrive in a more permissive environment, but the real evolution will be about legitimacy,\" Kurland said. \"The days of “pump-and-dump” meme coins dominating headlines could give way to community tokens with actual utility. Regulators might even embrace them as a way to engage younger investors, which would be the ultimate irony — a once-dismissed market segment becoming the poster child for crypto adoption."]}

The fund is designed to protect customer funds in case of unforeseen events such as hacks or exchange failures, providing an added layer of security.\nKakkar said the platform contributes 2% of its annual revenue to this fund, which stands at  ₹55.57 crore.\nCoinSwitch stores 95% of the funds in highly secure cold wallets. Srihari said this practice is a critical safeguard, as cold wallets are far less vulnerable to cyberattacks than hot wallets connected to the internet.\nBy distributing funds across multiple cold wallets, CoinSwitch minimizes the risk of a breach and ensures that most user assets remain safe from potential hacks or exchange downtime. “To run our day-to-day operations, we need only the remaining 5%, so there will be no issue with daily trading activities,\" added Srihari.\nAlso Read: Mint Quick Edit | Crypto’s comeback: Don’t over-read itMudrex stores the funds in secured institutional-grade custodians like Sifu and BitGo.

Buy 1 Year and Get 1 Year FREE on TheStreet Pro. Act now before it’s gone\n“We’ll just keep buying the top forever; every day is a good day to buy bitcoin,” the founder and chairman of MicroStrategy  (MSTR)  recently told CNBC.\n“I would have bought Manhattan 100 years ago, 200 years ago, every year for the past 300 years. You pay a little bit more than the person that bought Manhattan before you, but it’s always a good investment to invest in the economic capital of the free world,” Saylor said.\nOn Dec. 23, MicroStrategy officially joined the Nasdaq 100 index, along with Palantir Technologies  (PLTR) .\nRelated: Analysts sound alarms on Palantir stock into 2025\nPalantir’s stock has been viral this year, more than quadrupling (up 368%), fueled by its prominence in artificial intelligence data analytics for government and commercial clients.\nMicroStrategy has delivered an even stronger performance, with its shares quintupling (up 436%) year-to-date.\nMicroStrategy was primarily known for its business intelligence software before it pivoted toward Bitcoin.\nSaylor had initially dismissed bitcoin in 2013, calling it a bubble. But since 2020, he has become one of its most vocal advocates.\nIn 2020, MicroStrategy purchased $250 million of bitcoin, and it went on to make large purchases of the largest cryptocurrency.\nRelated: Cathie Wood sells $21.5 million of soaring tech stocks\nIn 2022 Saylor stepped away from his role as CEO to become executive chairman, and he said this was an ideal entry point to buy bitcoin.\n\"As executive chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives,\" Saylor said.\nIts stock performance now highly depends on the price of bitcoin. The company’s meteoric rise this year has been primarily driven by bitcoin’s resurgence in the latter half of 2024.\n\"We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,\" Saylor told CNBC in 2022.\nBuying a bitcoin exchange-traded fund means investors can invest in the crypto without finding an exchange, setting up a wallet, and handling the hassle of buying and storing bitcoin.\nIn January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first spot bitcoin ETFs.\nEarlier this month, the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs collectively exceeded $100 billion in assets under management, holding just over 1.1 million bitcoin, according to CNBC.\nBitcoin's surge was bolstered by the crypto-friendly policies proposed by President-elect Donald Trump.

Price in January has advanced an average of 3.35% since 2013 — and by nearly 57% in first quarters over the same time frame.\nBut Bitcoin is not alone in ending the year on a bit of a rough skid. Markets in general have been beaten down as the absence of a Santa Claus rally was felt in stocks as well with the Nasdaq 100 falling by about 5% since the Fed's last policy meeting in mid-December. Bitcoin fell by about 15% over the same stretch.\nHowever, as Fundstrat's Tom Lee recently noted — weakness in stocks to end a year doesn't necessarily mean a bearish start to the following year. In fact, data hints at the opposite.\nIn years where market breadth has been weak in December, January is usually a bounce-back month. This past week, only 18% of NYSE stocks advanced, which was the lowest-ever reading for the final three days of the year in last 65 years. As Lee also flags, forward returns from the 12 worst readings of market breadth at year-end since 1962 amount to about a 5% median gain in the following January readings at a 75% win-rate.\nIn this case, weakness to end 2024 could mean strength for stocks, and by extension, potentially Bitcoin in the new year.\nPerhaps that's why MicroStrategy continues to buy the Bitcoin dip. The company announced it had added another $209 million in Bitcoin to its coffers, bringing its total holdings to 446,400 BTC or nearly $42 billion.","Oops, something went wrong\nBitcoin price made history in 2024, and if a recent report is to be believed, the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $150,000 in the first half of 2025 and potentially hit $185,000 by the fourth quarter.\nGalaxy Research, the research arm of the digital asset management firm Galaxy, released this report last week, and with that, it has aligned itself with another digital asset management firm, VanEck, which has also anticipated Bitcoin appreciating by more than 50% from its current levels by 2025.\nKey excerpts from Galaxy Research’s report shared on the firm’s X account provide a glimpse into their outlook for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nThe firm predicted that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) will continue to thrive, potentially surpassing $250 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2025. Alex Thorn, the firm’s Head of Research, noted on X that U.S. Bitcoin ETPs are just $24 billion shy of overtaking all U.S. gold ETPs in AUM.\nGalaxy Research reported another big projection related to Ethereum’s native token, Ether, and said it would trade above $5,500 in 2025. That will happen because of the relaxation in regulations and the corporations’ adaptation and experimentation with the Ethereum technology.\nAlong with that, the Ethereum staking rate will increase by 50%, per report.\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, staking involves committing a certain amount of cryptocurrency to a blockchain network for a specified period. This process plays a crucial role in supporting the network’s operations, including validating transactions and maintaining its overall security.\n“The Trump administration is likely to offer greater regulatory clarity and guidance for the crypto industry in the U.S. Among other outcomes, it is likely that spot-based ETH ETPs will be allowed to stake some percentage of the ETH they hold on behalf of shareholders,” Galaxy Research posted on X.\nAs per the report, Dogecoin—the most popular memecoin and a favorite of Elon Musk—will reach $1 by 2025.\n“Dogecoin market cap will be eclipsed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which will identify and successfully enact cuts in amounts exceeding Dogecoin’s 2025 high-water mark market cap, “ Galaxy Research posted on X.\nOther than these forecasts, the report offers optimistic predictions for stablecoins, top publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin, and other market trends. However, it clearly mentioned that these projections are not intended as investment advice but are purely illustrative of potential market directions.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.","Date:\nShare post:\nDo you know when Bitcoin will surge again? The recent crypto market dip has reignited interest in the cyclical nature of cryptocurrencies. Recently, Bitcoin has retraced to $95,155 after reaching its historic $108,000 peak. Data shows that the next crypto bull run will help Bitcoin reach $180,000 or even $500,000. Bitcoin’s rise will drive a surge across altcoins, prompting searches for the next crypto to explode. This environment creates opportunities for investors to focus on innovative projects with strong potential and utility. Among seven such projects, Aureal One is the top choice. DLUME uses Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) for unparalleled scalability, rapid transactions, and near-zero gas fees. With these innovations, Aureal One could emerge as the next crypto to hit $1.\n\n\n\nTop 7 Next Crypto to explode\n\nAureal One (DLUME)\nDexBoss (DEBO)\nyPredict (YPRED)\nFlux (FLUX)\nCosmos (ATOM)\nVeChain (VET)\nKaspa (KAS) \n\nRecent news about Bitcoin’s dip to $95,155 after peaking at $106,000 has reignited market discussions.

We expect Bitcoin to hit a cycle-high of $200,000 in late 2025,\" analysts at brokerage Bernstein wrote in a client note earlier this month.\nMicroStrategy, a software firm that has become the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, has seen its shares surge nearly five-fold in 2024.\nThe stock, which joined the benchmark Nasdaq-100 index recently, is now seen as a proxy for bitcoin, with its movement closely tied to sentiment towards the digital asset. Several smaller companies are following its playbook and allocating portions of their cash to bitcoin.\n\"We expect bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier 'store of value' asset eventually replacing gold over the next decade and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management,\" the Bernstein note said.\nMuch of the optimism began in January when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first ETFs to track the spot price of bitcoin, marking a watershed moment for the broader crypto industry.\nThe move gave the sector institutional legitimacy and improved its mainstream appeal as traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the products.\nThe victory of Trump, who has promised to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the planet,\" further bolstered the industry's position later this year. Crypto advocates donated millions during the election, hoping to elect candidates that favor the sector.\nMost crypto stocks have also benefited from the industry-wide rally. The big winners of 2024 are MicroStrategy, crypto exchange Coinbase and bitcoin miner Hut 8\nOn the other hand, several other crypto miners have reeled under shrinking margins due to higher energy and hardware costs, missing the year's rally.\nShares of Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital and Bit Digital lost between 26% and 32% this year.\n(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)","Company’s share price has risen twentyfold after it changed its strategy to become first ‘bitcoin treasury company’\nIn the summer of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic upended economies around the world, an obscure US software firm decided to diversify. MicroStrategy, whose head office is situated next to a shopping mall and metro station in Tysons Corner, Virginia, had decided the steady business of “software as a service” was not racy enough.\nInstead, it would branch out by investing up to $250m in alternative assets – “stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin or other asset types”.\nLess than five years later, that bitcoin side hustle has gone stratospheric. MicroStrategy’s share price has swollen twentyfold, lifting its market capitalisation to almost $75bn and catapulting the stock into the Nasdaq 100 index of top technology shares.\nThe audacious bet by its co-founder and chair, Michael Saylor, has made MicroStrategy a top pick with UK investors, as digital currencies and tokens were boosted by Donald Trump’s election victory, despite worries that a sharp reversal in crypto prices could threaten its survival.\nSaylor’s strategy evolved into the world’s first “bitcoin treasury company”, with MicroStrategy pursuing a seemingly relentless approach of buying up bitcoin, funded by issuing billions of dollars of bonds and new shares. The company’s fans call this process a flywheel, in which issuing debt to buy bitcoin boosts the MSTR stock, allowing it to issue more shares to raise funds to buy more bitcoin.\nSaylor, who has compared bitcoin to Manhattan real estate in the year 1650, insists the company will pursue a long-term strategy of buying bitcoin, quarter by quarter.\nAn aeronautical and astronautical engineering graduate whose dreams of becoming a pilot or astronaut were thwarted by a medical condition, Saylor told Yahoo Finance recently that he expected to always buy bitcoin at the top of the market, predicting: “It’s going to appreciate against the dollar forever.”\nCritics point out that Manhattan property offers a guaranteed rental income as well as the prospect of asset value growth. Saylor, though, uses a measure called BTC Yield, which MicroStrategy calls a key performance indicator, tracking changes in the ratio between its bitcoin holdings and the number of company shares.\nWhile non-holders may look at bitcoin’s $100,000 price tag in December and think they’ve missed the boat, Saylor argued: “You’re getting a 90% discount from $1m a coin. I’m sure that I will be buying bitcoin at $1m a coin – probably a billion dollars a day of bitcoin at a million a coin.”\nMichael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, has claimed that MicroStrategy is “preying on investors” and pumping up optimism in bitcoin to drive higher volatility in its stock.\n“MicroStrategy’s stock valuation is at least double that of the bitcoin it holds. And, as a reminder, its software business has almost no value. One could even argue it has a negative value,” Lebowitz wrote in December. “Accordingly, investors who want to buy bitcoin should just buy bitcoin or the numerous bitcoin ETFs available.”\nIn the third quarter of 2024, total revenues at MicroStrategy’s software business fell by 10.3% year on year, and the company’s net loss more than doubled to $340.2m.\nDuring November, MicroStrategy was the most-bought equity by customers at the UK investment service Interactive Investor (ii), ahead of regular favourites such as Nvidia, Tesla and Lloyds Banking Group.\nAs of 31 December, MicroStrategy had spent $27.9bn acquiring a total of 446,400 bitcoins, at an average purchase price of approximately $62,428 each. Those bitcoins – equivalent to about 2% of the 21m bitcoins that can ever be produced – are now worth about $42bn.\nMicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. As of 12\/29\/2024, we hodl 446,400 $BTC acquired for ~$27.9 billion at ~$62,428 per bitcoin. $MSTR https:\/\/t.co\/58aXM7g6u2\nThis strategy has driven MicroStrategy’s share price up by almost 400% during 2024, a year in which bitcoin’s value more than doubled.\nThe flywheel had been expected to spin faster after MicroStrategy was added to the Nasdaq 100, as exchange-traded funds that follow the index must now automatically buy its stock. “It’s as if bitcoin was joining Nasdaq,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\nBut shareholders who bought in November may have seen their investment fall. MicroStrategy’s shares surged by 58% in November but have fallen by more than 20% in December.\nIn October, MicroStrategy announced it planned to issue $21bn of equity and $21bn of fixed income debt over the next three years to fund more bitcoin purchases.\nafter newsletter promotion\nShortly before Christmas, the company said it would ask shareholders for permission to issue billions more shares, increasing the number of its class A common stock from 330m shares to 10.33bn.\nMicroStrategy is attractive to investors who are eager to get exposure to bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency itself. They can hold its stock through a savings account such as a Roth IRA in the US, or an Isa in the UK.\n“MicroStrategy has been a popular investment among investors with a high appetite for risk for a couple of years,” said ii’s Lee Wild, describing it as “a bitcoin proxy”. “Further interest has been piqued by significant increases in the price of bitcoin, especially in February and November this year.”\nA key part of MicroStrategy’s approach is to issue convertible bonds with low, or no, interest payments. They are structured so that investors could be repaid in the company’s shares if the price rises sharply by the time the bond matures, in effect giving bond investors exposure to bitcoin.\nIn December, the company sold $3bn of convertible debt which matures in 2029. Those notes pay no interest but could be converted to stock at a price of $672, 55% higher than MicroStrategy’s share price of $433 on the day the debt was sold.\nRIA Advisors’ Lebowitz said MicroStrategy’s convertible bondholders would profit if the price of its shares is higher than the conversion price when their debt matures. But if not, they only get their original money back – missing out on years of interest payments had they lent the money elsewhere.\nThe worst-case scenario could be that MicroStrategy sells bitcoins to repay its $7.2bn of convertible debt as it matures, which Lebowitz said would be “very problematic if the price is much lower” than when the crypto was bought.\nHe called MicroStrategy “essentially a leveraged bitcoin holding company”. “The problem with such a leveraged scheme is that the company is putting all its eggs into bitcoin,” he said. “A sharp decline in bitcoin will likely accompany the collapse of MicroStrategy. The other risk, although less likely under the Trump presidency than Biden, is if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to investigate MicroStrategy over their ‘unique’ strategy.”\nSaylor, before he took up his role as one of bitcoin’s loudest evangelists, was most famous for losing $6bn of personal wealth in a single day in 2000, when MicroStrategy was forced to restate two years of revenues and its stock promptly dropped by 62%.\nMicroStrategy is not the only company pursuing the goal of becoming a bitcoin treasury. The crypto miner RiotPlatforms announced earlier this month it had acquired more than 5,000 bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 each, funded by a $525m convertible bond, while Tesla owns 11,509 bitcoins. But Microsoft’s shareholders voted against adding bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet this month.\nMin Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, has cautioned that MicroStrategy would be vulnerable to a drop in the value of bitcoin. “For now, bitcoin’s favourable price movement allows MicroStrategy to sustain a positive feedback loop: rising MSTR stock prices enable additional fundraising, which funds further bitcoin purchases, driving up bitcoin prices and stock value,” he said this month. “While effective during a bull market, this strategy’s sustainability depends heavily on continued bitcoin price appreciation.”\nWhile bitcoin’s loyal fans believe in holding on to their crypto during downturns, it is not yet clear whether MicroStrategy investors will take the same approach.","In this article\nBitcoin was far and away the best-performing asset class in 2024 as new exchange-traded funds ushered in more widespread adoption and hopes for deregulation under a new presidential administration lifted digital assets to record levels.\nBut owning cryptocurrency also came with its usual unpredictability and dizzying swings, as this month's trading clearly illustrates. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price since starting the year in the $40,000 range, with it last trading near $94,000. Ether has scored a nearly 50% year-to-date gain, and last traded at around $3,355.\nThe most prosperous stretch of the year occurred in the weeks following the U.S. presidential election. By mid-December, the cryptocurrency had rocketed above $108,000 for the first time, fueled by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris would open the door for greater regulatory clarity and send new money rushing into the sector.\nSince then, however, prices have eased. Bitcoin is negative for the month, hurt by the expectation that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts will roll out at a slower-than-anticipated pace. The market has also faced a stretch of apparent profit-taking and choppiness into the end of the year.\nThe year began with a strong boost of confidence from the introduction in January of new ETFs that hold the cryptocurrency. The funds, which are pitched by asset managers as a simpler way for investors to access bitcoin, have pulled in tens of billions of dollars of cash this year. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) now has more than $50 billion in assets.\nEther ETFs joined the excitement in July. The demand for those funds has not been as strong as for their bitcoin counterparts, but the category has still attracted more than $2 billion in net inflows in less than six months, according to FactSet.\nStrong tail winds for cryptocurrencies also lifted connected stocks to record levels. Bitcoin proxy Microstrategy has skyrocketed more than 360% since the start of the year, while Coinbase and Robinhood have rallied about 43% and 196%, respectively. MicroStrategy shares have surged since mid-December as the company was added into the Nasdaq 100 index.\nSome mining stocks, however, haven't performed as well, with Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms on track for double-digit year-to-date losses. The drop in mining stocks may be a direct result of this year's bitcoin halving, which reduced the block rewards. Along with transaction fees, this is one of the most significant ways miners make money.\n— CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting.","In the final trading session of 2024, Wall Street's major indexes opened higher, extending a bullish trend that began over two years ago. This growth, driven by post-pandemic resilience, optimism from lower borrowing costs, and the AI surge, has led the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq to nearly record-breaking levels.\nInterest rate cuts of nearly 100 basis points by the Federal Reserve and a rally in technology stocks have been pivotal, pushing equities to record highs. Notably, despite a smaller surge compared to last year, Nvidia still achieved a market value of $3 trillion, while Tesla regained its $1 trillion mark.\nDonald Trump's presidential victory further boosted market confidence, with risk-taking improvement and small-cap stocks recording gains. Meanwhile, inflationary concerns might influence the Federal Reserve's rate decision in 2025, as Bitcoin climbs to $100,000, strengthening crypto stocks like MicroStrategy.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025",null,"Terraforms Labs CEO Do Kwon spent the last day of 2024 getting extradited to the US, Reuters reports. Kwon faces charges in the US for \"orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving an algorithmic stablecoin and other crypto asset securities.\" The Terraforms co-founder has been held in Montenegro since March 2023, when he tried to board a flight with a forged passport — six months after Interpol put out a \"red notice\" warrant for his arrest.\nSouth Korean-based Terraforms Labs wiped out $40 billion from the crypto market when its TerraUSD and Luna stable coins turned out to not be so stable and collapsed in May 2022. Kwon had already fled South Korea the month before.\nThe US announced its charges in February 2023, with the SEC chair Gary Gensler stating, \"We allege that Terraform and Do Kwon failed to provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset securities, most notably for Luna and TerraUSD. We also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors.\" South Korea has issued similar charges.\nMontenegro doesn't have extradition treaties with the US or South Korea. The request played out in court over the last year and a half, with Montenegro's Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic ordering Kwon's extradition last week. Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US last January.","In a significant legal development, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has been extradited to the United States from Montenegro. This action follows allegations of investor deception related to the TerraUSD cryptocurrency's stability and application usage of the Terraform blockchain.\nThe extradition process saw Kwon handed over to U.S. law enforcement at Podgorica airport, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing legal battle. Kwon, who was detained in March 2023, maintains his innocence against these charges.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Kwon and Terraform Labs, attributing $40 billion in crypto market losses to the collapse of their stablecoin TerraUSD. As the legal proceedings unfold, questions linger over the future of stablecoins in the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","31st Dec, 2024. 05:02 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on May 25, 2025\nAs of Dec 31, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $94054.45.
