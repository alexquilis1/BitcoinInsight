The leading cryptocurrency dropped nearly 5%, trading at $60,834.\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which had been outperforming Bitcoin just days prior, saw a steeper decline, plunging over 6% to hover around $2,450.\nThe sharp sell-off in the crypto market mirrors the negative sentiment that gripped the broader financial markets on Tuesday following Iran’s attack on Israel. The geopolitical uncertainty has rattled investors, leading to a widespread risk-off approach.\nOther major cryptocurrencies also took a hit, with Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin falling by over 8%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. As a result, the global cryptocurrency market cap dropped 4.7% to $2.14 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nThe market’s volatility underscores the broader impact of geopolitical events on investor confidence across asset classes, particularly within the more speculative crypto space.\nMeanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and spot Ether ETFs had mixed outcomes. According to ETF tracker Farside, while spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced inflows in the past week, spot Ether ETFs saw a mix of inflows and outflows.\nInvestors will keep an eye on the trend in the coming days following the Fed’s interest rate cut and the escalating tension in the Middle East.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","01st Oct, 2024. 04:20 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 5, 2024\nAs of Oct 1, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $63880.87.

But I do think we’ll see a rapid jump, and then hopefully an extended elongated period of it being up before we revisit a bear cycle.”\n“One positive sign is that bitcoin’s extended flat period shows that sustained upside may last longer as well. Of course, this is all subject to macro events and other factors,” Bradford added.\nThe mining CEO also posited that bitcoin would likely enjoy a bump after the November presidential election, as volatility would quiet down. Similarly, additional interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely help bitcoin, as more investors explore the asset during a period of lower interest rates. Traders are often incentivized to explore riskier assets like bitcoin – particularly if they’re in search of higher returns – during periods of reduced risk.\n“I think we’ll start seeing a meaningful push in bitcoin prices post-election through January,\" Bradford said, \"which should result in significant margin expansion for well-placed miners with efficient cost structures.”","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAs October approaches, bitcoin – the world’s leading cryptocurrency – has continued to display resilience, recording recent price activity near $63,000. With “Uptober” on the horizon, analysts are adopting an increasingly bullish outlook, forecasting that the token is set to scale new heights.\nWith crypto’s overall market capitalization reaching $2.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap, market sentiment has displayed continued optimism. Despite closing September around $63,000, prominent crypto market analyst Michaël van de Poppe said that bitcoin is expected to reach highs of $90,000 to $100,000 by the end of this year.\nBrian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital, added that crypto investors were largely awaiting “breakout signals or shifts in market trends, particularly around key resistance and support levels like $62,500 for bitcoin.”\nThis year’s bitcoin halving and influx of institutional interest in response to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) has already catalyzed positive price momentum for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s recent decision to buy $1.11 billion of bitcoin (equivalent to 18,300 bitcoin) underlines ongoing institutional optimism around the asset, Dixon said. There’s “strong confidence from large investors in bitcoin's long-term value,” Dixon explained.\nHowever, Dixon said investors were in a holding pattern, awaiting “clearer market signals or regulatory news” to act on. With the U.S. elections in early November promising to shift regulation of the crypto sector, it remains to be seen how bitcoin markets will react to the outcome of the election.\nDixon highlighted that the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts have sparked greater interest in crypto. Broadly, the digital asset space is a \"maturing market where traditional finance's regulatory frameworks are increasingly intersecting with cryptocurrency operations,\" he said.\n\"I believe this could pave the way for more crypto-related financial products like ETFs, potentially opening floodgates for more retail and institutional investments, thereby impacting liquidity and market volatility,” Dixon said."]}

Its inverse relationship with the dollar also means that it has emerged as an attractive asset class amid greater volatility in the bitcoin market.\n\"Global instability, particularly in the Middle East, is strengthening oil and the dollar, putting pressure on bitcoin and other risk-on assets,\" Chris Kline, co-founder of BitcoinIRA, told TheStreet Crypto. \"After Bitcoin’s strongest September in over a decade, October is shaping up to be volatile, with the anticipated lagging effects of the April halving and a contentious U.S. election on the horizon.\"\nWith turmoil persisting in the Middle East, bitcoin is expecting greater market volatility. “The violence in the Middle East is not to the benefit of any risk assets,” said Two Prime CEO Alexander Blume. “Though bitcoin has characteristics that make it suitable as a safe haven asset, like unconfiscatability and finite supply, the market mainly treats it as a speculative asset. Further escalation of hostilities will likely not be good for the price of bitcoin in the short-term.”\nMoreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts and increase in money supply has intensified currency wars, Kline added. \"This backdrop of geopolitical tensions, monetary policy shifts, and political uncertainty creates a perfect storm for market volatility in the coming month,\" he said.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Reuters) - Crypto asset manager Bitwise has filed an initial registration statement with the U.S. SEC for an exchange-traded product for XRP tokens, as it seeks to introduce more crypto products after a landmark regulatory decision to approve spot bitcoin ETF earlier this year.\nBitwise earlier this year was among the firms which got the nod from the Securities and Exchange Commission for their bitcoin ETFs.

The U.S. domestic investing community, both on the retail and on the institutional side, will now have this available.” He emphasized that the availability of banking resources would expand bitcoin's options market, adding, “It will enable one to be able to make pretty good relative value bets between MicroStrategy stock and options, the mining sector, and now bitcoin itself.”\nRob Nelson highlighted a point brought up by Jon Najarian, a commodities trader in the traditional finance space, saying, “If you can trade those options, that’s a big deal if you're an investor and you could actually trade those options in crypto, in bitcoin.” Pine expanded on this, noting, “This does enable one to take a bet that allows you to go long premium with a limited risk investment in a sector that has been traditionally extremely volatile.\"\nPine also touched on the opportunity to collect options premiums in bitcoin trading, pointing out that bitcoin's higher implied volatility compared to stocks could present lucrative opportunities.

As violence continues unabated in the Middle East, bitcoin is expected to see further downward pressure. As the attack escalated, other cryptocurrencies were also impacted. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, ethereum, for example, also plummeted by 6.3%. It currently sits at a price of $2,456, according to CoinMarketCap.\nAdditionally, bitcoin mining companies have also been negatively impacted, with Marathon Digital seeing its shares drop almost 9% and briefly settle at a new price of $14.84.\nDespite “Uptober” promising to emerge, market activity has not reflected this just yet. While the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts offered some buoyancy to crypto markets, bitcoin is still struggling, though many market analysts see its long-term forecast as ultimately resilient.\nOn average, October typically sees the world’s largest crypto enjoy gains of 22.9%, but it remains to be seen if this will materialize.\nThere are some bright spots, however: On Sept. 27, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded more than $400 million in inflows, representing one of the largest inflow records for a single day since mid-June.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) push for derivatives trading being listed on Nasdaq. The move will bring enhanced liquidity and market depth, and will allow institutional investors to manage their investment risks more effectively, experts predict. They will also be able to deploy yield strategies."]}

Blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket shows that Sassaman is the leading candidate, though the implied probability that he is Satoshi has dropped on the site to 21% from as high as 68% on Oct. 3.\nMemecoins are cryptocurrencies without any utility that have become especially popular in the past year, as blockchains like Solana make it much cheaper to create and trade the tokens. Pump.fun, a platform with a design similar to the anonymous social media platform 4chan, has all but eliminated the technical complexities involved in creating a memecoin. Anyone can to go to Pump.fun and make a memecoin in a few seconds. Some traders have even created tokens related to Sassaman’s cat Sasha.\n“Memecoins are acting like decentralized prediction markets, with many variations of a single theme popping up around emerging topics,” said Ben Yorke, vice president of ecosystem at crypto exchange WOO X. “Unfortunately, this creates a negative-sum environment, where insiders and influencers profit by steering trends they control. On the other hand, everyday investors struggle to correctly guess the trend even as they struggle to identify the real token that’s representing the trend.”\nThe late Sassaman’s wife Meredith Patterson has denied in the past that he was the creator of Bitcoin. Still, the memecoin craze around Sassaman has gotten so popular that Patterson posted on social media platform X on Oct. 5 that some people were sending her memecoins that honor her cat.\n“Right, so, me not knowing really anything about the world of memecoins, I apparently sent a few DMers a Coinbase address,” she wrote. “But if people are insisting on sending me memecoins about my cat, I’m not gonna say no.”\nBitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and published the technical paper outlining the concept in late 2008. The creation of Bitcoin was inspired by the 2008 global financial crisis with the aim of establishing a decentralized digital currency system that can be operated without any intermediaries.\nThere have been many previous efforts to reveal Nakamoto’s real identity, including a piece in Newsweek a few years ago that claimed Dorian Nakamoto created Bitcoin. The Japanese-American engineer denied his connections to Bitcoin.\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The overall market sentiment this month, however, remains optimistic, especially if 'Uptober' comes to pass despite the early volatility.\nWhales on the Move\nThere's been a dramatic drop in the number of bitcoins held on crypto exchange reserves, which have hit a six-year low. This decline signals that large holders, known as \"whales,\" may be accumulating bitcoin at an unprecedented rate. While reserves have been steadily decreasing, 2024 has seen a remarkable acceleration in this trend. In some cases, data points to the amount of accumulation mirroring early 2017 or 2019 levels.\nInstitutional Interest Soars\nThe surge in institutional interest is a key factor driving demand. Companies like MicroStrategy are continuing their aggressive buying strategies, while big Wall Street players like BlackRock continue to scoop up interested investors through their massively popular bitcoin ETFs.\nLast week, however, saw a brief period of net outflows among investors in bitcoin ETFs, according to CoinShares. After three weeks of net inflows, bitcoin asset product outflows stacked up to total $159 million.\nMarket Dynamics\nThis month, analysts are closely monitoring these institutional movements. The rapid accumulation by major financial players is creating a supply squeeze, which could put upward pressure on Bitcoin's price. Analysts speculate that if this trend continues, bitcoin might hit its historical price rally of 30% this month, reigniting the possibility of the world's largest crypto scaling new all-time highs.\nNavigating Volatility\nDespite the bullish outlook, some traders remain cautious. Political and geopolitical events may inject volatility into the market, spurring occasional dips. Nevertheless, the overall trend appears positive, bolstered by the influx of institutional capital and dwindling exchange reserves.\nEven if a possible October break out takes time, it is entirely possible to experience three consecutive weeks of bearish performance in crypto markets – making the prospect of another strong Uptober possible.","07th Oct, 2024. 03:18 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Jan 24, 2024\nAs of Oct 7, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $63066.48.

The FBI’s Ethereum-based token, NexFundAI, was created with the help of “cooperating witnesses.”\nAs a result of the investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three “market makers” and nine people for allegedly engaging in schemes to boost the prices of certain crypto assets. The Department of Justice charged 18 people and entities for “widespread fraud and manipulation” in crypto markets.\nThe defendants allegedly made false claims about their tokens and executed so-called “wash trades” to create the impression of an active trading market, prosecutors claim. The three market makers — ZMQuant, CLS Global, and MyTrade — allegedly wash traded or conspired to wash trade on behalf of NexFundAI, an Ethereum-based token they didn’t realize was created by the FBI.\n“What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime,” Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division, said in a statement. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.”\nLiu Zhou, a “market maker” working with MyTrade MM, allegedly told promoters of NexFundAI that MyTrade MM was better than its competitors because they “control the pump and dump” allowing them to “do inside trading easily.”\nAn FBI spokesperson told CoinDesk that there was limited trading activity on the coin but didn’t share additional information. On a Wednesday press call, Joshua Levy, the acting US attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said trading on the token was disabled, according to CoinDesk.\nThe DOJ has reportedly secured $25 million from “fraudulent proceeds” that will be returned to investors.","Date:\nShare post:\nAs the world of cryptocurrency grows, new tools and technologies are changing the way users handle digital assets.

The charges are the first in the crypto industry related to \"wash trading.\"\nThe practice involves moving assets back and forth between accounts controlled by the same firm, giving the appearance of higher trading volume and artificially boosting the value of the asset.\nThe sting came after the SEC tipped off the FBI to potential market manipulation by a Boston-based crypto firm called Saitama, which at one point had boasted a multi-billion market value, the press release said.\nThe tip prompted prosecutors to launch a fake crypto firm called NexFundAI and create a fake token. Over the monthslong operation, the FBI witnessed three market makers wash trade tokens for crypto clients, offering to manipulate the price of NexFundAI's token via video calls and Telegram chats.\nThe sting charged ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade with wash trading related to their communications with NexFundAI. A fourth firm, Gotbit, was not involved with NexFundAI but was charged in a similar scheme. The sting also charged 15 individuals, including six people associated with Saitama.\nThe firms' trading scheme \"allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars,\" Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Boston Division, said in a statement.\nThe prosecutors say those charges mark the first of their kind in the crypto industry, even as the practice of wash trading has been outlawed and strictly enforced in other financial markets.\n\"Cryptocurrency is no exception. These are cases where an innovative technology – cryptocurrency – met a century old scheme – the pump and dump. The message today is, if you make false statements to trick investors, that's fraud. Period,\" Acting United States Attorney Joshua Levy said in a statement released Wednesday.\nThe charges come as crypto-related scams are on the rise. The FBI's 2023 internet crime report shows crypto fraud cost investors almost $4 billion last year. One kind of scam, \"pig butchering,\" has stolen at least $75.3 billion in crypto in recent years, according to one study.","President Donald Trump said this week Jerome Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.”\nSign up for the CEO Daily newsletter\nGet global perspectives and insights from CEOs on the biggest stories in business.\nThe U.S. economy is in chaos.

Can Bastian keep it up if the economy loses altitude?","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nOn Wednesday, a judge unsealed a wide-ranging criminal case brought by the Department of Justice against eighteen individuals and companies accused of manipulating crypto markets and artificially boosting tokens. According to the complaint, the operation targeted one crypto firm with a multi-billion-dollar market value, and relied on a ruse involving a new cryptocurrency spun up by the FBI.\nThe indictment is the first criminal prosecution by the DOJ against financial services firms for crypto market manipulation, after previously charging an individual, Avraham Eisenberg, who was convicted in April for rigging a platform called Mango Markets.\nThe most notable feature of the case, though, was the methods employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigations to nab the defendants. According to a statement from Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, the Bureau took the \"unprecedented step\" of creating its own cryptocurrency token and a fake company to help ensnare the alleged crooks.\nThe crypto industry is no stranger to market manipulation, where token prices are often artificially influenced through practices such as wash trading, where participants fake buy and sell orders to create the appearance of demand. The practice is especially prevalent among offshore exchanges, with independent analysts estimating that as much as 50%—or more—of trading is inflated.\nThe DOJ's case targets three market makers and their employees, which prosecutors allege offered wash trading services in exchange for payment. The indictment describes the investigation as \"the first of its kind,\" though prosecutors note that pump and dumps are a \"century-old scheme.\"\nTo uncover the operations, the FBI created a token called NexFundAI that operated on the Ethereum blockchain, eventually meeting with the market makers to discuss employing their services. One of the defendants described himself as the \"mastermind,\" explaining that his company used bots to buy and sell at the same time on centralized exchanges to generate trading volumes. While agreeing to an in-person meeting in September, he asked for an upfront payment of $2,000. As late as last week, the market maker's bots were still making millions of dollars worth of wash trades before being deactivated at the request of law enforcement.\nAccording to the crypto price tracker DEX Screener, a token launched on Oct. 9 called NexFundAI was still trading actively with a market cap of around $237,000 at the time of publication.\nSeveral of the defendants worked at Saitama, a Massachusetts-incorporated crypto firm that manipulated its token price to create a market value of $7.5 billion. Saitama worked with one of the alleged market makers, Gotbit, to artificially inflate the value of its token. The DOJ alleges that Saitama executives were secretly selling their tokens for tens of millions in profits. In 2019, a Gotbit cofounder told CoinDesk that his business was \"not entirely ethical.\"\nSeveral of the defendants operated internationally, including in Portugal and Russia, and five have already pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty. Along with the DOJ indictment, the Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil complaints alleging securities law violations against the market-making operations.\nUpdate 10\/10\/24: Include more details on the NexFundAI token trading volume.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"]}

Unbeknownst to the alleged fraudsters, the FBI created the token to lure and expose those engaged in illegal market practices.\nFour crypto firms – Gotbit, CLS Global, MyTrade, and ZM Quant – and 18 individuals now face charges for artificially inflating token prices through fraudulent trades. The defendants allegedly used a practice known as wash trading, where fake trades are executed to create the illusion of high trading activity and demand.\nZM Quant, one of the accused market makers, reportedly accounted for over 80% of NexFundAI's trading volume in May. The firm allegedly advised on how to artificially inflate the token's price, unknowingly participating in the FBI's sting operation.\n\"This investigation, the first of its kind, identified numerous fraudsters in the cryptocurrency industry. Wash trading has long been outlawed in traditional financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception,\" Acting US Attorney Joshua Levy said.\nThe operation resulted in the seizure of more than $25 million in cryptocurrency and the deactivation of trading bots responsible for manipulating approximately 60 different cryptocurrencies. Four defendants have already pleaded guilty, with others arrested in Texas, the United Kingdom, and Portugal.\nJodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Boston Division, described the operation as \"a new twist to old-school financial crime.\" She said that the FBI's creation of a cryptocurrency token was an unprecedented step in identifying and disrupting fraudulent activities in the crypto space.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also filed civil complaints against several involved entities for alleged securities law violations. The charges include market manipulation, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and wire fraud, which can lead to sentences of up to 20 years.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the operation has sparked some pushback. A pseudonymous developer known as cygaar claimed that the FBI appeared to have copied several OpenZeppelin libraries without adhering to the MIT License requirements.\nHi @FBI, I noticed that your smart contracts are in direct violation of the MIT License, and thus are subject to copyright infringement.\n\nYou clearly copy pasted several of OpenZeppelin's libraries (which use the MIT License), but don't have a license on the code yourself.\n\nThe... pic.twitter.com\/T4DkGnjshW\nAdditionally, the FBI may have inadvertently exposed its own wallets used in the operation. Coinbase director Conor Grogan noted that the wallet used to seed NexFundAI distributed capital across several wallets and executed trades, potentially impacting future investigations.\nFrom what I can tell, FBI-linked wallets have recently deposited to Tokenlon, Binance, Zixipay, and HTX.\n\nHere is part of their portfolio if you want to copy trade. The FBI is long ETH pic.twitter.com\/gkvesnn5qp\nGrogan found that FBI-linked wallets own coins like Pornrocket, EthereumMAX, and BONE.\nThe FBI is now reaching out to potential victims of NexFundAI and related tokens, setting up a dedicated form for those who may have lost funds."]}

He explained how bitcoin is already being widely transacted, but the introduction of ETFs has brought it more firmly into traditional financial settings. “The ETF has brought the properties of bitcoin into the traditional financial world,\" he noted.\nGiordano further emphasized how the options market enhances traders' control. “It just adds more ability to manage your exposures,\" he explained, adding that options enable investors to enter and exit positions more quickly. \"You don't have to pay for a hundred percent of the cost of these options because a lot of them are out of the money,\" he said.\nNot everyone in the bitcoin space is convinced it's necessarily a fully positive development, however. Former Wall Street executive turned Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long warned an increasingly large bitcoin options market could weigh on spot bitcoin price — or potentially lead to shell games that have plagued traditional finance.\nThe issue with such layered financial products is that they can create feedback loops between the derivative price and the underlying spot price. “There’s a lot of leverage on the derivative itself, and there’s even more coming now with options,” she continued. “So the question is, which came first? The chicken or the egg? What drives the spot price?”\nOn the plus side, Giordano concluded that bitcoin options provide traders with more tools to manage risk and adjust their positions effectively, further deepening bitcoin’s role within both digital and traditional financial systems.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe price of bitcoin returned above $65,000 on Monday, a critical resistance level for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin saw its highest price in two weeks, as investors had uneven reactions to China’s economic stimulus efforts over the weekend.\nIndeed, China’s attempt to rejuvenate its economy has boosted interest in riskier assets like bitcoin and altcoins – cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin – as traditional stocks face skepticism.\nBitcoin's $65,000 price point is also continuing to boost altcoins. Over the weekend, ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose in price, clearly benefiting from bitcoin's upward trend.\nOctober has historically been a significant month for bitcoin, often marked by major price movements. Despite the bullish momentum, it’s still not clear if the much-anticipated “Uptober” has arrived, and market analysts warn that it still might be premature to cast that label, given the market's volatility and unpredictability.\nWhile past Octobers have shown positive price action for bitcoin, each year carries unique circumstances impacting market behavior.\n“My fear is that we try to derive meaning from repetition when it might just be coincidence and investors should be careful,” said James Toledano, the Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet. “We know from traditional markets and the wisdom of seasoned investors not to look for patterns or try to time the markets.”\nThere are complex factors that drive cryptocurrency markets, he added. He pointed to 2021 as an example of how specific events, rather than seasonal patterns, drove significant price movements. In 2021, institutional investment and mainstream adoption spurred bitcoin to rise by 40%, but Toledano said this was ultimately “down to specific events.”\nLikewise, this year's unique geopolitical tensions also led bitcoin to plunge 4% in the beginning of October 2024, mirroring “historical patterns of mid-month recoveries.”\nLiquidations also play a role: “Liquidation spikes have also been common in October, with 2024 seeing $540 million in liquidations early in the month. This aligns with past years when liquidation events preceded a recovery,” Toledano added.\nDespite the mixed signals, Toledano acknowledges that October has shown a tendency for positive endings in the past. “October has tended to end positively, and it’s not uncommon for the month to start with a dip. In 2023, Bitcoin lost 7% in the first half of the month before rallying by 30% toward the end,” Toledano said.","14th Oct, 2024. 04:21 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 10, 2024\nAs of Oct 14, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $64925.48.

Offering unmatched security and enticing rewards, Plus Wallet is the ultimate choice for smooth and secure crypto trading.","Bitcoin has the potential to hit an all-time record in the next couple of weeks ahead of the election, Standard Chartered says."],"article_contents":["This article was published more than 6 months ago. Some information may no longer be current.\nSam Sivarajan is a keynote speaker, independent wealth management consultant and author of three books on investing and decision-making.\nAI-driven stocks such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q have dominated news headlines and sparked a rush among investors hoping to cash in on the next big thing. But as the flow of money into these stocks continues to surge, it’s worth asking: Are investors, especially DIY investors, chasing the hype and getting ahead of themselves?\nThe answer is likely yes. Goldman Sachs reports that “tech giants are set to spend over US$1-trillion on AI in the coming years, with little to show for it so far.” MIT economist Daron Acemoglu argues that “truly transformative changes will take time, with few expected in the next decade.”\nRetail investors often get swept up in market hype, as we saw in the dot-com bubble and cryptocurrency craze. Those who invested at the peak saw their portfolios crash when the bubbles burst. DIY investors are prone to biases such as overconfidence and recency, making impulsive decisions that professional advice could prevent.\nAnd it’s not just novices – sophisticated DIY investors can also fall victim to emotional, biased decisions. As behavioural finance expert Meir Statman has noted, frequent traders underperform dramatically compared with their more patient, buy-and-hold counterparts. Prof. Statman’s research reveals that heavy traders lagged index investors by more than seven percentage points a year, while light traders trailed by just a quarter of a percentage point.\nDIY investors can easily fall into the trap of overestimating their abilities. They may believe that access to information (such as trends in AI stocks) equips them to make savvy trades. However, as Prof. Statman’s findings highlight, many end up switching between funds – especially in high-risk, high-reward sectors such as tech – and significantly underperform. For instance, those who jumped between technology funds lost 13 percentage points a year compared with buy-and-hold investors.\nEven hedge fund investors, often viewed as highly sophisticated players, are not immune to underperformance. A study by professors of accounting Ilia Dichev and Gwen Yu found investor returns in hedge funds lagged buy-and-hold returns by 3 per cent to 7 per cent a year.\nFinance professor Brad Barber’s study of users of investing app Robinhood highlights another DIY investor challenge: attention-driven trading. Robinhood’s trending stocks feature often leads users to chase fads, resulting in losses. The research shows that stocks heavily purchased by Robinhood users tend to have negative returns, on average -4.7 per cent, over the following 20 days.\nThese patterns are not unique to finance. The phenomenon of overconfidence extends to other fields as well. Doctors sometimes misdiagnose themselves, and a popular saying is that a lawyer who represents themselves has a fool for a client. It’s not that these professionals have lost their skills – they’ve simply lost their objectivity. Just like DIY investors.\nWithout a dispassionate, external perspective, many investors allow emotions to cloud their decisions. This can lead to impulsive trades driven by fear of missing out or irrational exuberance over the “next big thing.”\nGood professional advisers manage clients’ biases and emotions, becoming behavioural coaches rather than stock pickers, helping investors stick to a plan. They can provide a buffer between investors and the psychological traps that can derail their financial goals. Morningstar found that, over the decade ending Dec. 31, 2023, the average investor lagged the average fund by 1.1 per cent a year, missing out on about 15 per cent of the total returns as a result of poor timing of buying and selling. A behavioural gap.\nBut does that mean investors should surrender all control to professionals? Not necessarily. A more nuanced approach involves co-creating investment strategies. The “IKEA effect,” a psychological principle that suggests people place more value on something they’ve helped create, offers compelling support for this approach. Similarly, a study involving children cooking alongside their parents found that kids ate more salad and vegetables when they helped prepare them.\nThe same holds true for investing: If investors are actively involved in shaping their financial plans, they’re more likely to stick to them.\nThis collaborative approach can help investors feel in control, while still benefiting from the objective guidance of professionals.\nFor DIY investors drawn to AI stocks and other trends, key lessons apply:\nIn investing, less excitement usually means more success. As Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson put it, “investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.”\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nEditorial code of conduct\nStudy and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

It might finally come in the next few weeks, Standard Chartered says.\nIn new research, head of digital asset research Geoff Kendrick estimated that the token could hit $73,800 before November's US presidential election, a 12% gain from current levels.\nTo back this, Kendrick cited a shifting pattern in how bitcoin has traded against MicroStrategy, a firm best known for accumulating massive amounts of the token — a stockpile that recent reached 252,000 bitcoins.\nAs the chart below shows, after trading relatively in lockstep with bitcoin throughout 2024, MicroStrategy has broken out. Kendrick says the two fundamental factors responsible for that premium are likely to drive bitcoin higher, closing the gap over time.\nThe first of those factors is news from last month that BNY Mellon was exempted from SAB 121, an unpopular legislation that forces dealers to list crypto on their balance sheets. Easing regulation is often a cited tailwind for bitcoin.\nSecond, SAB 121 exemptions go hand-in-hand with MicroStrategy's announced plan to become a \"bitcoin bank,\" offering bitcoin capital market instruments down the road. Kendrick expects a future exemption could allow the firm to earn yield by lending out bitcoin.\n\"The link between these two for me is that as the broader digital asset ecosystem becomes more legitimate\/accessible, MSTR's multiple goes up,\" Kendrick said.\nIn Kendrick's mind, the outcome of the presidential election is secondary to these bullish forces, with both Trump and Harris victories boding well for the token.\n\"As we approach the US election ... the broader digital asset ecosystem is indeed becoming more likely to become mainstream,\" he wrote.\nKendrick has previously expressed that both candidates should boost the asset long-term, though Kendrick says a Donald Trump presidency would be the more bullish of the two outcomes. If the Republican candidate returns to the White House, he estimates that bitcoin could surge as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

It read: “Today the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.”\nThe price of Bitcoin spiked more than $1,000 apiece following the post, according to the indictment. After the SEC regained control of its account and issued a statement clarifying that the post was a result of a breach, the price of Bitcoin plummeted by more than $2,000.\nAt the time, cryptocurrency investors had been closely watching for the regulator’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which would allow Bitcoin-related assets to be traded as exchange-traded funds. The SEC issued its official approval of the Bitcoin products the following day.\nAccording to the charges, the SEC and X confirmed that the hack was carried out using a method known as “SIM swapping.” That’s when a fraudster impersonates someone else to a cellular carrier and obtains their SIM details, including their phone number.\nCouncil received other personal identifying information to make a fake ID, which he used to obtain a SIM card linked to the victim’s phone line, the indictment alleges. He then bought a new iPhone with cash and obtained access codes to the @SECGov X account, which he allegedly shared with co-conspirators to  gain access to the account.\nAfter issuing the fake post, Council allegedly received payment in Bitcoin before returning the iPhone.  He later conducted internet searches for “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them,” the agency said.\n“These SIM swapping schemes, where fraudsters trick service providers into giving them control of unsuspecting victims’ phones, can result in devastating financial losses to victims and leaks of sensitive personal and private information,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves. “Here, the conspirators allegedly used their illegal access to a phone to manipulate financial markets.”\nCouncil will make his first court appearance on Thursday in the Northern District of Alabama.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","The FBI says that Eric Council Jr. used a SIM swapping attack to make a fake X post from @SEC claiming Bitcoin ETFs had been approved.\nThe FBI says that Eric Council Jr. used a SIM swapping attack to make a fake X post from @SEC claiming Bitcoin ETFs had been approved.\nby  Emma Roth\nThe FBI has arrested an Alabama man who is accused of hacking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account in January.

He then allegedly tricked AT&T into providing a SIM card with the victim’s phone number and install it into a new iPhone he purchased. Finally, Council was able to gain control of the SEC’s account using recovery authentication codes sent to the number, and later return the iPhone to the Apple Store where he’d bought it.\nInvestigators also found Council made some questionable searches from his personal computer:\nHe later conducted internet searches for “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them.”","Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nFollow:\nA version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\nThe bitcoin bulls and meme stock traders are fired up about the prospect of another Donald Trump White House. Or at least, the prospect of doing some momentum trading over the next 18 days.\nHere’s the deal: Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, surged briefly to a three-month high above $68,000 on Wednesday — driven by a mix of signals, including the former president’s statement on X that “crypto is the future” as well as Vice President Kamala Harris’ nod Monday to regulatory support for digital assets.\nAt the same time, shares of Trump Media were bouncing back from Tuesday’s mysterious 10% drop and resuming their meme-stock-esque tendency to rise without any fundamental reason to do so. The stock finished Wednesday up more than 15%.\nWhat do the two assets, a digital currency and a media stock, have in common?\nNot much, usually. But in recent weeks, they’ve both seemingly moved on traders’ perceptions of Trump’s reelection odds.\nTo be clear: These traders don’t have a crystal ball — they’re just gambling, with varying degrees of sophistication, on highly volatile assets.\nCrypto traders are amped because of the Republican nominee’s apparent 180 on the asset class he once dismissed as a scam. Even though Tuesday’s launch of the Trump-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial revealed tepid interest and numerous technical outages, the former president has spent months courting the industry’s billionaires and generally telling enthusiasts what they want to hear.\nThat enthusiasm went into hyperdrive Wednesday as Trump expanded his lead over Harris on a crypto-focused predictions website called Polymarket, where you can bet on the election outcome. As far as those investors are concerned, Trump has a 59% chance to Harris’ 41%. (That’s wildly out of step with national polls, including CNN’s “Poll of Polls,” which currently show a virtual dead heat.)\n“As we get closer to the election, the voting estimates may create swings in the market,” says Steph Guild, senior director of investment strategy at Robinhood. Bitcoin may benefit if Trump’s odds improve, she said, “given he is seen as more friendly to crypto in general.”\nOutside of the election prediction game, though, there are plenty of macro tailwinds propelling bitcoin, a bellwether for the broader crypto industry, Adrian Fritz, global head of research for crypto firm 21Shares, tells me. Not least: Central banks around the world are cutting interest rates, making risky assets like crypto more palatable. Plus, it’s #Uptober, aka the month when digital assets historically have had a good ride.\n“It’s no surprise that it became way more political on both sides,” Fritz says. “The good thing is, it draws attention to the entire space … We truly believe that, no matter who’s the winner, it’s a net positive for the industry.”\nTrump Media, meanwhile, is also experiencing a pre-election surge. But it is in a class of its own when it comes to turnover and meme-stock-like fluctuations.\nIn the past week, the equivalent of all of the DJT shares available for trade have changed hands multiple times, with the people holding onto the stock for an average of just two days, writes Barron’s journalist Al Root. For comparison, Root notes, Apple shares take more than a year to completely turn over.\nThat kind of volatility makes crypto look stable by comparison, but it attracts a certain kind of iron-stomach trader hoping to buy on the upswing and sell before it peaks. (Sounds easy, but your investment adviser would tell you you’re better off going to a casino because at least there you might have a nice cocktail and enjoy playing cards while you burn your money.)\nThe momentum plays are “absolutely” happening, Fritz says. “It’s not only on the retail side, but also professional investors … the basis trade has one of the most popular strategies when it comes to bitcoin,” he said.\n(In other words, hedge funds are leveraging up to do complex trades that exploit small price differences between bitcoin’s spot price and futures market prices, and that’s amplifying trading volume even more.)\nBottom line: Both bitcoin and Trump Media could become even more volatile over the next few weeks as more traders pile in. But if pundits or voters are looking to the market for signs of which way this presidential election thing will go, keep in mind: Traders gonna trade. While some true believers may be putting their money into seemingly pro-Trump assets, the vast majority are just working the casino floor, trying to cover their bets and capture a few wins.","President Donald Trump said this week Jerome Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.”\nSign up for the CEO Daily newsletter\nGet global perspectives and insights from CEOs on the biggest stories in business.\nThe U.S. economy is in chaos.

The token was trading at $66,857 on Thursday afternoon.\nThe gains for the cryptocurrency accelerated in early October when Trump overtook Kamala Harris among bettors as the favored winner.\nMarkets have been broadly behaving like Trump will win next month, but bitcoin and crypto have been standouts in the Trump trade.\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller highlighted the dynamic in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday, noting the market seems \"very convinced Trump is going to win.\"\nHe added: \"You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto.\"\nBernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said last month that a Trump win could be monumental for the crypto industry.\n\"Crypto is the rare instance, where the difference in election outcome could determine the destiny of the industry,\" Chhugani said, adding that he expects bitcoin to soar to $90,000 if Trump wins.\nTrump's embrace of the crypto industry has been years in the making.\nThe former president addressed the Bitcoin Conference in July with a 45-minute speech, and has talked about crypto policy in nearly every speech since. He's also released several NFT collections over the past two years.\nAt the Bitcoin Conference over the summer, Trump said he'd lay out a plan \"to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.\"\nThis past week, Trump was part of the launch of a crypto token called World Liberty Financial.\nBitcoin might be ultimately front-running a potential Trump win in November, with the cryptocurrency up 59% year-to-date.\n\"Elections remain hard to call, but if you are long crypto here, you are likely taking a Trump trade,\" Chhugani said.\nYet, investors in the world's largest cryptocurrency could also be getting ahead themselves, as betting market websites like Polymarket aren't a perfect indicator of election odds.\nWhile Polymarket shows the odds of Trump winning in November rose to 62% on Thursday, the polls are telling a very different story. According to the latest polling, the election is still too close to call with both candidates virtually tied or within the margin of error in the major battleground states.\nThe sharp divergence in Trump's betting market odds and the polls has even led some to speculate that someone might be making massive bets on Trump in an illiquid betting market to make it appear that he's more likely to win the election.\nInternet speculation has swirled around the identity of a single \"whale\" who has bet as much as $25 million via multiple accounts on Polymarket, single-handedly boosting Trump's betting odds on the platform.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

Gold soared to a record high on Middle East tensions and U.S. election uncertainty. Investors are cautious, awaiting further Chinese stimulus details."],"article_contents":["Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nOn Monday, the price of bitcoin shot up past $69,000, before correcting to $67,510, where it is currently sitting at the time of writing.\nWhile this sharp plunge worried many in the crypto space, others say that the bitcoin market simply overheated and there is no reason to worry.\nOne reason for bitcoin's initial jump to $69,000 might stem from macroeconomic factors, particularly the political landscape surrounding the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Increasing odds of a potential return of former President Donald Trump has historically sparked Bitcoin rallies, as many investors view his pro-crypto stance as a positive influence on the market.\nAs the day progressed, however, bitcoin's price underwent a sharp correction, plummeting to approximately $67,510. This precipitous plunge drew concern among some investors in the space, particularly as it coincided with a spike in futures open interest to a new all-time high of $40.5 billion.\nDespite Monday's rally being short-lived, many analysts view this as a natural market movement rather than a cause for alarm.\nFirst, there was market overheating – the rapid ascent to $69,000 likely led to some profit-taking and the requisite cooling-off period. This is often seen as healthy market behavior, preventing unsustainable bubbles.\nSecondly, there are signs of technical resistance. For example, the $69,000 level may have acted as a strong resistance point, triggering sell orders and contributing to the subsequent dip.\nThird, this is also part of crypto's normal pattern of volatility. Such price swings are not uncommon, particularly after reaching new highs.\nFourth, bitcoin still enjoys a bullish outlook. Indeed, despite bitcoin's rollercoaster ride, many experts maintain a positive long-term outlook. For instance, some forecasts suggest that if bitcoin crosses the $70,000 threshold, it could pave the way for further gains, potentially reaching new all-time highs. And finally, some analysts point to strong support levels around $66,500, indicating that the current price is still within a bullish range.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nInvestment opportunities beyond bitcoin took center stage as Roundtable anchor, Rob Nelson, asked Gary Cardone of Cardone Digital Ventures for his perspective.\nWhile both acknowledged bitcoin’s position as a unique long-term asset, Nelson sought to understand where Cardone sees potential in other sectors. Cardone offered a look into his investment philosophy, emphasizing his focus on bitcoin and highlighting infrastructure and compliance ventures, like Node 40, as areas worth watching.\nGary Cardone emphasized his continued interest in bitcoin, stating, \"I don't have enough bitcoin yet, so I have a goal of how much bitcoin I want.\" He reflects on how he could have better aligned his past investments with the direction the world is heading, saying, \"Had I taken that money from the old world and understood where this planet was going...this is going to fill a gap.\"\nCardone further noted the growing institutional interest in bitcoin, adding, \"Now Franklin Templeton and BNY Mellon are here. And if you notice, every major player has taken a piece of the value chain.\" He sees this as a pivotal moment for bitcoin’s future, especially with the involvement of sovereign entities.\nWhen discussing other investments, Cardone remains cautious about sectors like real estate, mentioning uncertainties such as rising insurance costs and HOA fees. Instead, he chooses to focus on compliance companies like Node 40. \"Node 40 is going to be a great business...if you don't already have enough bitcoin.\" He emphasizes the need for companies to become compliant, which will drive demand for services like Node 40.\nIn conclusion, Gary Cardone makes it clear that while there are many opportunities in the market, he remains laser-focused on bitcoin and select ventures that align with the evolving financial landscape.","Asia's stock markets displayed significant volatility on Monday, driven by underperformance in Chinese equities. This contrasts with the strong performance of Bitcoin, which has reached a three-month peak due to persistent speculation around 'Trump trades.'\nGold prices surged to a record high, fueled by ongoing tensions in the Middle East and an uncertain U.S. presidential election landscape. Investors remain wary, eagerly waiting for additional details on Chinese fiscal stimulus initially announced in September.\nChinese authorities reduced the benchmark lending rate, an expected move that had minimal impact on markets. As the U.S. election approaches, market focus turns to Trump's economic policies, perceived to favor cryptocurrencies, while stimulating gold demand and impacting U.S. dollar performance.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025"]}

On Wednesday, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of over 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its price hovering around $65,000. This decline has dashed hopes of breaking the $70,000 threshold, which had gained traction just a week prior. The downward trajectory underscores the growing volatility in the crypto market and highlights the interconnectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets.\nThe decline in Bitcoin can be attributed to mounting pressure on technology stocks, particularly Tesla (TSLA), which is set to release its latest earnings after the closing bell. Analysts anticipate that Tesla will report earnings per share of 60 cents, a decrease from 66 cents a year ago, although the figure marks an improvement from 52 cents in the previous quarter, according to estimates from FactSet (FDS). Revenue is projected to hit $25.4 billion, compared to $23.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and $25.5 billion in the preceding quarter.\nMeanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has continued its upward climb, reaching 4.23%—a level not seen since July. Higher bond yields traditionally create downward pressure on equity valuations. When Treasury yields rise, it suggests that investors are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, leading them to favor safer investments like bonds over stocks.\nOther significant cryptocurrencies have also faced losses. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours, currently trading around $2,500. Cardano fell by more than 3.5%, Avalanche dropped by over 4.5%, and the popular memecoin Shiba Inu decreased by approximately 3%.\nOverall, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has contracted by 2%, now standing at $2.2 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."]}

Debates are emerging over which outcome would be more favorable for the cryptocurrency in the long run. The growing engagement from both ends of the political spectrum underscores how crypto has become a contentious and pivotal issue in the 2024 election. Here’s what you need to know.\nThis election year, former President Donald Trump positioned himself as a “crypto candidate,” actively embracing digital assets as part of his campaign. He even started accepting campaign donations in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana, among others.\nOf course, not all crypto enthusiasts are Trump supporters, but many welcome his recent pro-crypto stance. For instance, at a Bitcoin conference, Trump promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office — a move that resonates strongly with crypto advocates, as Gensler’s policies have often been unpopular in the cryptosphere. Trump further promised to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, an ambitious goal that has captivated many in the crypto community. While he hasn’t specified the details or timeline for such a step, the fact that he’s made Bitcoin a central talking point in his campaign has stirred considerable excitement.\nConsidering these factors, it’s clear that a Trump victory could drive an immediate surge in Bitcoin’s price, which would uplift the whole crypto market. Still, it’s hard to know what Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory would be under a Trump presidency.\nAccording to Chandra Duggirala, co-founder and CEO of the interoperability-focused crypto platform Portal To Bitcoin, a Trump victory could have varied impacts on Bitcoin in the long run. If Trump wins and the U.S. government starts actively holding Bitcoin, wealth managers might start viewing it as a credible asset, which could accelerate Bitcoin adoption in traditional portfolios, he told Quartz in an email.\n“This newfound confidence could result in increased inflows into Bitcoin funds and related investment products, driving up demand and, potentially, its market price,” he added. “The ripple effect could create a rally in Bitcoin prices as global investors follow the U.S.’s lead in integrating Bitcoin into mainstream financial portfolios.”\nOn the other hand, Vice President Kamala Harris, who had previously been cautious about discussing cryptocurrencies, recently has begun to address the topic more openly. She has called for stronger regulatory oversight of the crypto market, emphasizing the need for clear rules to ensure consumer protection and financial stability.\nGiven Kamala Harris’s late and lukewarm response to Bitcoin, many anticipate an immediate dip in leading cryptocurrency’s price if she wins, followed by a possible rebound later.\nDuggirala explained to Quartz that a Harris victory would likely indicate a continuation of the current administration’s economic policies, which emphasize increased fiscal spending and progressive taxation. A Harris administration might also implement more stringent regulatory scrutiny, especially concerning private capital and the crypto markets.\nDuggirala noted that if high inflation persists alongside ongoing regulatory pressure, assets like Bitcoin and gold could benefit as investors seek ways to preserve their wealth amidst these challenges.\n“The scarcity-driven value of Bitcoin could position it as a top choice for those aiming to safeguard their wealth in a potentially inflationary landscape,” he said.\nMany polls indicate a tight race between Trump and Harris, which could lead to an election outcome fraught with controversy and litigation. During periods of heightened uncertainty, assets characterized by high volatility often see increased trading volumes, benefiting derivatives traders. With its historical price fluctuations, Bitcoin may emerge as a preferred asset for options traders looking to capitalize on potential price swings, Duggirala noted.\n“During periods of market distress, Bitcoin has displayed a tendency for sharp price moves, both upward and downward,” he said. “In March 2020, at the height of the pandemic market crash, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by nearly 50% in a matter of days, only to recover and soar to new all-time highs within months.”\nIf the election results in prolonged uncertainty, options trading on Bitcoin could prove exceptionally profitable. Historically, Bitcoin futures and options volumes surge during periods of heightened market volatility, as witnessed during the bull run from late 2020 to early 2021, Duggirala told Quartz.\nFor seasoned traders, a contested election presents an excellent opportunity to leverage Bitcoin’s volatility, attracting increased attention to Bitcoin markets globally, he added.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, climbing from around $71,000 on Tuesday morning to $72,000 by the afternoon and finally surpassing $73,000 by late afternoon. This surge comes just a week before the U.S. elections, a period many traders perceive as bullish for the markets, regardless of the election outcome. Polls suggest a tightly contested race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, adding to market anticipation.\nThe leading cryptocurrency is currently at $73,562, having risen nearly 6% in the last 24 hours and 8.75% over the week. It is now only 1% below its record high of $73,737, which it last reached in March.\nThis recent price surge coincides with a pivotal week for big tech earnings, as industry giants such as Meta (Facebook’s parent company) (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (Google’s parent company) (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are set to report their quarterly results. These earnings could significantly impact the broader financial landscape, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s momentum by providing insights into market sentiment.\nInvestors continue to bet on Bitcoin ETFs, which has also driven up the price of Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin ETF tracker Farside, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to see massive inflows, with aggregated net inflows of $479.4 million on Oct. 28.\nOn Monday, BlackRock’s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) (IBIT) attracted the most $315 million in inflows, while the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) received $59 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund saw an inflow of 44 million, and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) (BITB) followed with just over $38 million.\nBitcoin’s recent price surge has buoyed the entire cryptocurrency market, sparking notable gains across various digital assets. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $2,600, marking an increase of over 6% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, popular memecoins have seen substantial upticks: Dogecoin (DOGE) has jumped by more than 19%, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up over 14% in the same period. These gains highlight renewed investor enthusiasm across diverse sectors of the crypto market.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."]}

Earlier it fell as much as 7%.\nHere's what the company reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\nCoinbase, which operates the largest U.S. marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, reported net income of $75.5 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with a year-ago loss of $2.3 million, or 1 cent a share.\nNet income in the latest quarter included $121 million in pretax losses on Coinbase's crypto investment portfolio, the vast majority of which were unrealized, as crypto prices were lower on Sept. 30 compared with June 30.\nWithin its core business, revenue from retail trading grew 98% to $483.3 million from the previous year, while institutional revenue brought in $55.3 million during the quarter, a 292% jump from the same period a year ago. Total transaction revenue was $572.5 million, a 98% increase year-over-year.\nRevenue from Coinbase's subscription and services – which includes stablecoins, staking and leverage for Prime traders among other things – saw a 66% increase from a year ago to $556.1 million.\nThe company forecasted flat growth in the category, reflecting a 10% decline in the price of ether in October compared to its third-quarter average, as well as interest rate cuts reflecting market expectations, among other headwinds.\nThe cryptocurrency market has been in a bit of a slump for much of this year, stuck in a narrow range between $55,000 and $70,000. Bitcoin has been absent any significant catalysts and suffered low volatility as investors monitored the U.S. presidential race and largely stood on the sidelines. Coinbase has been an active lobbyist for the crypto industry this year, spending millions backing pro-crypto political action committees.\nStablecoins — widely believed to be crypto's killer app — were a bright spot in the third quarter. While crypto price action has been tepid, the market cap for stablecoins reached new highs, helping push Coinbase's third-quarter stablecoin revenue to $246.9 million. That's an increase of 2.6% quarter-over-quarter but up 43% from the same period a year ago.\nCoinbase has a 50\/50 revenue sharing agreement with Circle for the interest income of the reserves backing USD Coin (USDC), the second largest dollar-backed stablecoin on the market. That revenue could be challenged in the current quarter with interest rates expected to continue coming down.\nThe company also announced a $1 billion stock buyback in its earnings report."]}
