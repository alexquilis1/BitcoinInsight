Worries about U.S. regional banks have worked in bitcoin's favor since last year's regional banking crisis, when investors who lost confidence in the banks turned to the cryptocurrency as a hedge against uncertainty.\nTraders also point out that bitcoin accumulation by large investors, known as \"whales,\" has increased in the past two weeks, when the cryptocurrency's price has been stuck below December and January highs.\n\"What's happening now appears to be large investors – whales, institutions, others – accumulating assets ahead of what many believe will be a strong bull cycle through the end of the year,\" said Bartosz Lipiński, CEO of crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange. \"One only needs to look at the number of bitcoin wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC, which has risen significantly over the last two weeks and now includes an additional 73 participants that previously weren't holding such a significant amount of the cryptocurrency.\"\nOver the past two weeks, bitcoin's average daily trading volumes fell 29.6% week-over-week, JPMorgan pointed out in a note Thursday, while ether trading volumes decreased 40%.\nShares of crypto exchange Coinbase jumped about 8.59%, while bitcoin proxy Microstrategy added 15.71%. In the mining group, CleanSpark rose 12.78%, Riot Platforms advanced 15.28%, while Marathon Digital gained 23.03% and Iris Energy surged 23.79%.\n—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","A legendary market prophet has warned that the S&P 500 could crash 30% to a three-year low, the US economy is barreling toward a recession this year, and the buzz around bitcoin and artificial intelligence is massively overblown.\n\"Stocks are very expensive and very distorted,\" Gary Shilling told Business Insider in an interview. He compared the \"tremendous weighting\" of the \"Magnificent Seven\" in indexes today to the \"Nifty Fifty\" group of stocks in the 1970s, noting that high-flying members such as Kodak and Polaroid eventually plummeted in value.\n\"When people focus on a very narrow segment of the stock market, they, in effect, are saying the rest of the stock market just isn't of interest and probably in trouble,\" he said.\nShilling, who was Merrill Lynch's first chief economist and launched his own economic-consultancy and investment-advisory firm in 1978, said the S&P 500 could plunge below 3,500 points to its lowest level since late 2020.\nThe benchmark stock index tumbled 20% in 2022 but rebounded 24% last year and has climbed another 4% this year to a record high of more than 4,900 points.\nThe president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., known for making several correct market calls over the past 40 years, also cautioned that stocks could disappoint for years to come.\nThey've returned an average of 12% a year, including dividends, since the market bottomed in 1982, but he said their future gains could falter thanks to modest economic growth and valuations at \"nosebleed altitudes\" today.\nThe veteran forecaster predicted a recession this year, even though growth and employment data have been strong in recent months, inflation has dropped from more than 9% at its peak to below 4% in recent months, and the Federal Reserve has penciled in several cuts to interest rates after hiking them from virtually zero to more than 5% in under 17 months.\nShilling pointed to several \"classic signs\" of recession, including an inverted yield curve, protracted declines in leading economic indicators, and weakness in the Small Business Jobs Index. He also noted there had been only a single soft landing since World War II, defining one as a period when the Fed has hiked and reduced interest rates without a recession taking hold.\nThe star economist said the idea of a recession was supported by the Fed's plan to hold off on cutting rates until it's sure inflation is under control, companies' labor hoarding limiting layoffs and most likely delaying rate cuts, and longer-term headwinds including an aging population and tepid productivity gains.\nShilling also warned that US consumers had nearly exhausted their pandemic savings based on recent increases in late payments on credit cards. He added that the resumption of student-loan repayments would take more cash out of people's pockets.\nShilling touched on two of the hottest market trends as well. He bemoaned the \"really excessive speculation\" fueling demand for bitcoin, slamming the leading cryptocurrency for having zero substance, suspicious beginnings, and appearing to be useful only for illegal transactions.\nMeanwhile, he cast doubt on the idea that AI is a revolutionary technology that will supercharge productivity and accelerate growth — a belief that has propelled stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft to record highs. He questioned whether tasking huge computers with trawling through massive amounts of data to find patterns would result in much value at all.\nIt's worth underscoring that Shilling has raised the alarm on stocks and the economy several times in recent months, yet both have defied his grave predictions and performed strongly.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges",null]}

Someone got so excited they hacked the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s website to break the news just a little bit earlier. Though a bunch of people — mainly the ever-woeful Grayscale trust — got out of their holdings after the rules of the market changed, a different bunch of people (or maybe even the same people seeking a better deal on fees) moved their money over to one of the nine other bitcoin ETFs that sprung up last month.\nInflows are flowing, with Bloomberg reporting that $8 billion of investment money is being pumped into offerings from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. Now bitcoin is at $47,000, its highest point in two years. And some think it might be able to go higher.\nAnother factor driving up bitcoin prices could be the soon-coming, so-called “halving,” an every-four-years event in which computers that mine the cryptocurrency will receive half the reward for the efforts in order to restrain supply. Though technically the endpoint is the same (a 21 million-bitcoin limit), this is the kind of narrative event that drives interest and speculation in a financial commodity with no moorings in the real world. It’s not going to reach $100,000, but the Motley Fool’s David Jagielski thinks it has a good shot at hitting $50,000.\n“Based on a price of $43,000, Bitcoin would only need to rise a little more than 16% for its valuation to top $50,000, a level it hasn’t been at since 2021,” he writes. “If it rises by around 20%, then it could end up around $52,000 at the 150-day mark, which would be sometime in September.”\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","BREAKING: Dow Jones Cuts 600-Point Drop, Oil Stocks Up\nInvestors.com will undergo scheduled maintenance from 10:00 PM ET to 2:00 AM ET and some features may be unavailable.

Before that, bitcoin had not seen the $48,000 level since March 2022.\nBitcoin trading volume and sentiment have been suppressed over the past two weeks as investors worried about big outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF and a deeper pullback in its price ahead of an expected rip higher this year.\nNevertheless, bitcoin finished the week up 10.76% for its best week since Dec. 8. Ether finished higher by 8.46%, making this week its best since Jan. 12. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next.\nPositive sentiment appears to be returning now as the GBTC outflows have slowed. Additionally, momentum from the S&P 500 briefly touching 5,000 Thursday for the first time ever may be spilling over to crypto.\n\"The recent price appreciation of bitcoin could be attributed to recent inflows into the spot ETFs, the prospect of the halving around the corner, which tends to generate optimism from investors as prices often shoot  up after, and general market momentum,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\"In the past, there have been parallels between bitcoin and tech stocks,\" she added. \"Lower rates, falling inflation, earnings growth and indices like the S&P 500 hitting groundbreaking levels certainly improve risk sentiment for the asset class.\"\nThe move pulled crypto equities higher. Crypto exchange Coinbase rose 7% Friday and bitcoin proxy Microstrategy gained nearly 10%, while the biggest miners, Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, rose 11% and 10%, respectively.\nBitcoin is nearing a key resistance level, which Fairlead Strategies earlier this week identified at $48,600. Hitting that level would open the door to a new all-time high, the firm said.\nOn Thursday, bitcoin passed $45,000 for the first time since Jan. 12, the day after U.S. bitcoin ETFs began trading. The cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain its pre-ETF highs but has avoided falling to as low as $36,000, as expected. It has not fallen below $39,000 in the past month.\n—CNBC's Nick Wells contributed reporting.\nCorrection: On Friday, bitcoin crossed $47,708.00 for the first time since Jan. 11. An earlier version of this story misstated the time interval.",null,null,"Bitcoin rallied Friday toward its highest level since March 2022, erasing January’s nearly 20% selloff during its post-ETF hangover.\nBlackRock is among the firms to launch a bitcoin ETF last month.\nBitcoin jumped 6% in the 24-hour period ending at about 9:30 a.m. ET, sitting at about $47,700, still far short of its 2021 peak of almost $69,000.\nThat would best January’s end-of-day peak of just shy of $47,000, and officially wiped out last month’s roughly $150 billion selloff that sent bitcoin as low as $39,000.\nBitcoin’s recent rally comes amid record highs for stocks as investors whet their growing risk appetite, and more directly as demand for the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) introduced Jan. 11 proves robust.\nAlso rising Friday were smaller tokens Ether (up 3% over the last 24 hours), Binance coin (1%) and Solana (1%).\nShares of crypto-first stocks surged in morning trading, as leading U.S. exchange Coinbase's stock jumped 6% and miners CleanSpark, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ stocks each jumped at least 5%.\n8%. That’s how much further bitcoin needs to gain to top a $1 trillion market value for the first time since late 2021, when it peaked at over $1.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. For reference, only seven companies in the world have market capitalizations over $1 trillion, though of course owning bitcoin does not directly equate to owning shares in a company.\nSpot bitcoin ETFs enable individuals to invest in same-day bitcoin prices on exchanges not solely focused on crypto, theoretically opening the door for a new class of investors. The funds are operated by the likes of old-school asset managers like BlackRock and crypto-first institutions like GrayScale. The bitcoin ETFs have received net capital inflows of $1.8 billion in their first month of existence, according to data compiled by Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Bitcoin’s recent run-up follows optimism about the new demand untapped by the ETF approval and about the upcoming halving event which cuts rewards for miners, theoretically causing prices to go up as supply grows slower.",null]}

Assets under management at these issuers total around $28.35 billion, making for a market cap of $39.8 billion, according to Blockworks data. Trading volume across 24 hours was $1.38 billion.\nLeading the spot bitcoin ETF pack is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust at $20.27 billion, followed by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust at $3.31 billion and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust at $2.75 billion.\n“The sustained inflows and volumes are higher than I anticipated,” said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. “The fact that there haven’t been just day-one flows, but strong positive inflows in 18 of the first 19 days is really gratifying. It makes me extremely optimistic on where bitcoin’s price is going, and its importance in the world.”\nBitwise runs the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP, currently the fourth-largest spot bitcoin ETF by market cap. But the road to this point wasn’t easy. In fact, Bitwise took over 20,000 meetings last year with financial advisors in preparation for the anticipated approval, Hougan said.\n“It was nerve-wracking to launch, while we’re not BlackRock, we’re not new to this space. [But] we provide crypto asset funds so we needed to be relevant,” Hougan said. Now, he believes ETFs have reached escape velocity and are “big enough to be sustainable from an economic perspective.”\nBitwise’s fee, 0.20%, is the second-lowest of the lot, and Hougan believes it’s a “pretty good deal” in an effort to be competitive. But if its fund becomes extremely large, he said he did not know if that rate will stick.\n“Right now, we like our position.”\nHow low can bitcoin ETF fees drop before it hurts a business?\nHougan also believes that demand will continue to rise as more national account platforms come online and inbound interest from large institutions increases. “It’s not like they’re buying $100 million of bitcoin today, but there’s significant inbound and meetings with platforms that have billions of dollars in assets.”\nA month after the approvals were handed down, Hougan thinks spot bitcoin ETFs will hold the title for the “biggest ETF launch of all time.”\n“Even after being in the ETF industry for 15 years, it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen…it’s not just a little bigger; it’s much bigger.”\nhttps:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/01\/10\/grayscale-ceo-spot-bitcoin-etf\/\nIn the next 11 months, Hougan is optimistic that volumes will continue to increase due to the passage of time and bitcoin’s price spurring demand. The natural audience for this product takes time to learn and make decisions and national accounts take time to improve them, he added.\n“I think it’ll be up, plateau, re-acceleration,” Hougan said. “I don’t think demand is slowing down for the next 18 months. I expect these ETFs to set records.”\nAs for what’s next, Bitwise is leaving the door open for other products.\n“We don’t have a filing, but certainly thinking about Ethereum [spot ETFs] and you can imagine we’re thinking of other things you can do with bitcoin and ethereum,” Hougan said. “We’ve entered the ETF era of crypto and we’ve proven investors want to access crypto through ETFs. We’re going to provide those products to the extent possible under regulation.”\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Crypto\nJacquelyn Melinek was a reporter at TechCrunch covering cryptocurrency.\nOpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3B, with news expected later this week\nOpenAI debuts Codex CLI, an open source coding tool for terminals\nMicrosoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\nDeck raises $12M to ‘Plaid-ify’ any website using AI\nSubaru debuts Trailseeker, an all-electric SUV coming for Rivian’s outdoorsy EV customer base\nFor security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\nNotorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked","As ever for bitcoin's spot price, values have been volatile this year but analysts say there have been several factors behind its recent recovery and believe its looming \"halving\" event could help further.\nBusiness and economics reporter\n              @SkyNewsBiz\nMonday 12 February 2024 18:46, UK\nBitcoin has returned to the $50,000 level for the first time since December 2021, riding on the coat tails of a wider rally for US stocks.\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency, which hit one-month highs last Friday, maintained its momentum on Monday by rising almost 5%.\nRivals, such as ether, saw similar percentage moves.\nAnalysts credited several factors for recent crypto gains, saying that wider market sentiment was benefiting from growing expectations of central bank interest rate cuts.\nThe prospect of cheaper borrowing costs ahead helped the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to record intraday highs earlier in the day.\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq was just shy of breaking through its best-ever level.\nBitcoin's recovery from a wave of scandals, including the fraud-driven bankruptcy of the FTX exchange, was aided last month when US regulators backed the creation of 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nThese are investment products based on market prices that allow investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without owning the currency directly.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's decision was seen as giving cryptocurrencies a form of official legitimacy for the first time, despite deep scepticism remaining over the lack of wider rules and oversight.\nThe body is currently reviewing applications for ETFs linked to ether's spot price.\nBitcoin values were hurt by a wave of ETF outflows earlier this month but the price wobble ended on Friday when they were reported to have been replaced with net inflows.\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nThe news helped leave bitcoin more than 10% up on the start of the year.\nIt topped $50,196 on Monday evening, according to LSEG data.\nThe all-time high for bitcoin's value came in November 2021 when it exceeded the $65,000 level.\nAnalysts said the recent surge in value was also attributable to the next bitcoin \"halving\" event, expected in April.\nThat process is designed to slow the release of bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21 million tokens - of which 19 million have already been created.\nBitcoin rallied on the previous three halvings, the most recent of which was in 2020.\nBen Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, said: \"With [the] fourth bitcoin halving, a first Fed interest rate cut and potential ethereum spot ETF approval, all are significant for what is the smallest, youngest and most retail-dominated asset class.\"","This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.\nA month after bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched in the US on 11 January, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency surpassed $50,000, its highest since December 2021. The price of the digital asset climbed as high as $50,328 on Monday before settling a little above $50,000 by the end of the day, lifting bitcoin's market capitalisation above $1 trillion for the first time since November 2021.\nA higher flow of funds into the cryptocurrency since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs in January is seen as the main trigger for the latest rally, which started about a week ago.\nBitcoin surged 150% in 2023 partly in anticipation of bitcoin spot ETFs by early 2024. Its price has risen another 16% so far this year (as of 13 February), helping many who stayed invested to recoup some of their losses from the 2022 crash.\nOther than higher inflows, which have been led by institutional investors, the anticipation of cues from the US Federal Reserve on when it might start cutting interest rates, and the imminent halving of bitcoin rewards in April-May are triggers for the latest rally. These developments are expected to push the price of bitcoin higher in 2024. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled for 19-20 March.\nThe SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on 10 January. Nine bitcoin spot ETFs were launched the following day, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was also turned into an ETF the same day. However, the price of bitcoin tumbled 20% from $49,000 on the day of the spot ETF launch to below $40,000 by 22 January. The cryptocurrency then began a steady rise on 26 January.\nThe price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021 before crashing to $15,760 in December 2022 amid the collapse of FTX, then the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, and charges of fraud against its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Fears about worsening macroeconomic conditions and rising interest rates also contributed to the collapse.\nNow back around $50,000, bitcoin has come a long way since those dark days. Mint explains why bitcoin is surging again.\nHigher inflowsThe recent surge in bitcoin prices was driven by an estimated $1.1 billion flowing into ETFs during the past week — the highest weekly inflow since the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. This inflow has seen ETFs collectively amass 200,000 bitcoins, pushing up the price of the digital asset, which has a limited supply and a cap on the number of new tokens added every day. More funds are expected to flow into bitcoin spot ETFs in the coming weeks and months as it becomes a mainstream asset class in investors’ portfolios.\n\nImminent halving of rewardsWhile demand is rising, supply is set to be further restricted in about two months. The creators of bitcoin designed the cryptocurrency to have an upper limit of 21 million coins, which they felt would create a scarcity and thus push up its value. So far, a little over 19.6 million have been ‘mined’, and 900 bitcoins are currently added every day. A new block is added to the chain once about every 10 minutes, and crypto miners are rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins at present for every block they create.\n\n     \n      Bitcoin’s inventors designed this reward to halve every time 210,000 blocks are added to the chain, which usually happens every four years. This next halving of rewards is expected to take place in April-May, so miners will receive only 3.125 bitcoin per block until the next halving.\n\n     \n      As the halving of bitcoin rewards slows the increase of the cryptocurrency’s supply, its price usually starts to rise well in advance, and soars after the halving. For instance, in the 12 months after the most recent halving in 2020, bitcoin gained about 560%. And in the 12 months after the first halving in 2012, it jumped more than 8,000%.\n\nExpectation of rate cutsRising interest rates affect cryptocurrencies, as they do all risky assets. When the Fed kept rates steady at its December meeting, cryptos gained. If it now signals that rate cuts may begin as early as June 2024, as some analysts expect, investors are likely to increase their allocation to risky assets such as crypto.

The world's largest cryptocurrency last traded at $50,000 in December 2021.\nThis marks a notable recovery from the setbacks faced by the crypto industry, including scandals and bankruptcies, which cast doubts on the sustainability of digital assets.\nBitcoin has tripled in value since the beginning of last year, rebounding from a 64 percent decline in 2022. Despite this surge, the current price remains below the all-time high of nearly $69,000 recorded in November 2021.\nBitcoin's price fluctuations have historically attracted speculators, and the recent rally is attributed to optimism following the United States' regulatory approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for direct Bitcoin ownership, as per the report. Analysts believe this approval is contributing to increased mainstream acceptance, it said.\n\"There is a lot of talk about the inflow of money into this asset. I'd also note that the momentum players are getting excited as well,\" Matt Maley, Chief Market Strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. told Bloomberg.\nInvestors in broader financial markets are embracing risk, anticipating a shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy. This change in sentiment has spilled over into digital assets, as per the report. Crypto-related companies, including MicroStrategy, Coinbase Global, and Marathon Digital, experienced 10 percent, 4.8 percent, and 12 percent of gains on February 12, it added.\nBitcoin has now fully recovered from losses incurred since the implosion of stablecoin TerraUSD in May 2022, which triggered a series of failures leading to the November 2022 downfall of the FTX exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Further, recent legal developments, such as Bankman-Fried's conviction for fraud, and the legal issues faced by Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, have also reduced perceived risks in the crypto industry, contributing to the upward movement in prices.\nThe debut of nine US spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11, along with the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, has widened the investor base for Bitcoin. The new funds have attracted approximately $8 billion, while the outflow from the Grayscale fund since its conversion is slowing.\nFadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at crypto-custodian Copper Technologies, emphasised the role of enthusiast buyers, telling Bloomberg, \"Enthusiast buyers bring in more enthusiast buyers pushing prices further up. The cryptocurrency has momentum on the back of several green weeks and has a large chance of going up further when markets see weekly movements upwards of 10 percent (as we saw last week).\"\nThe positive sentiment is also influenced by optimism surrounding the quadrennial Bitcoin halving scheduled for April. And amid the current Lunar New Year holidays in Asia, sentiment towards Bitcoin is described as \"typically positive,\" according to Fundstrat Global Advisors. The cryptocurrency's momentum, fueled by consecutive positive weeks, remains a key factor driving its upward trajectory.\n“The total crypto market capitalisation has risen to $1.87 trillion with Bitcoin crossing $50,000 for the first time in two years. As expected, Bitcoin soared to $50,000 after holding and breaking above the $49,000 support. On the other hand, Ethereum is trying to break the $2,700 resistance which might be successful when Bitcoin dominance decreases from the current 52 percent,” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India’s second-longest-running digital asset exchange told Mint.\n“There are approximately 60 days until the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 which could potentially push the cryptocurrency market to new highs,” he added.\n“The macro factors such as the anticipated rate cut by the US Fed and the growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs will drive the market in the mid to long term. We can expect Bitcoin to retest its all-time high of $69,000 post-halving,” Thakral said.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The cryptocurrency has risen some 16.3% so far this year, on Monday touching its highest since Dec. 27, 2021. At 11:31 a.m. EST (1731 GMT), bitcoin was up 5.58% on the day at $50,196.\n\"$50,000 is a significant milestone for bitcoin after the launch of spot ETFs last month not only failed to elicit a move above this key psychological level but led to a 20% sell-off,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lending platform Nexo. Crypto stocks also enjoyed a boost on Monday, with crypto exchange Coinbase up 4.86% and crypto miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital up 11.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Shares of software firm MicroStrategy -- a notable buyer of bitcoin -- were up 11.7%.\nThe price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 4.08% at $2,606.60.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\nBitcoin's \"sell the news\" type of move is officially over, with the world's pre-eminent cryptocurrency managing to recoup all of the losses incurred in the aftermath of the launch of some of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. As animal spirits return, investors are now turning their attention toward upcoming bullish catalysts, including an event that does not have much relevance for the Western world but one that has exercised substantial influence over Bitcoin in the past nine years.\nMatrixport's head of research and the founder of 10x Research, Markus Thielen, has identified a unique phenomenon over the past nine years, where Bitcoin inexplicably begins to rally three days before the Chinese New Year and continues to do so for a further ten days after the renewal of the Chinese calendar:\n\"Bitcoin tends to increase by +11% from three days before Chinese New Year (therefore, the rally should start on Wednesday, February 7, approximately Bitcoin @ 43,000) and last until early next week.\"\nOf course, this strategy has received quite a lot of attention this year, which should dilute much of its alpha-generating potential. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see if the Chinese Dragon manages to roar again.\nBear in mind that 10x research also expects Bitcoin to hit the $52,000 price level in February 2024, which would constitute a new cycle high.\nAs we noted in a recent post, much of the recent weakness around Bitcoin could be pegged on FTX's estate, which essentially reduced the defunct crypto exchange's sizable Bitcoin stash locked within Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ETF to zero in recent days.\nBitcoin ETFs absorbed more Bitcoin in less than a month than Microstrategy since it started buying.\nThink about it 1, 3, 5 and 10 years out. Bitcoins sold to ETFs may not be available for sale anytime soon. ETFs tend to be long term holdings. https:\/\/t.co\/6MjVvn6kWG\n— Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) February 11, 2024\nWith the persistent selling pressure from FTX tapering off in recent days, spot Bitcoin ETFs' soaring inflows are now acting as a critical bulwark for the world's pre-eminent cryptocurrency. These ETFs have now recorded cumulative net inflows of $2.23 billion. Last week alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.1 billion in net inflows.\n❖ Prepare for a Bitcoin FOMO rally to record highs: Bernstein\nOn Friday, Bitcoin crossed the $48,000 mark, registering a 13% increase over the past week and edging closer to the key $50,000 resistance level.\nDespite a significant upturn in 2023, with a 160% increase, and…\n— *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) February 12, 2024\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, \"Bitcoin's best days are yet to happen as the ETF-driven market fuels fears of missing out (FOMO).\"\nWith much of the recent overhang removed, crypto enthusiasts can now prepare for the upward thrust that is likely to materialize in the run-up to the next halving event in April 2024, when the reward for mining Bitcoin will again be cut in half in what is a regular 4-year cycle, unleashing a potent deflationary wave in the process.","Bitcoin topped $50,000 on Monday for the first time in more than two years\nThe token hit a record high of $50,334 early on Monday, representing a roughly 15% increase since the start of the year and marking the highest level since December 2021. The rise has been driven by bullishness among investors for bitcoin ETFs, which were first approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month.\nAfter a lukewarm reception, the investment products aimed at investors who want exposure to bitcoin without going through the hassle of buying it directly, have begun to gain more traction. Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano told CNBC on Monday that bitcoin ETFs sucked up 5% of the entire tradable supply of bitcoin in 30 days.\nThe jump in bitcoin's price also comes amid a broader risk-on shift as investors get ready for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. The cryptocurrency has rallied alongside the stock market, with the S&P 500 closing above 5,000 for the first time ever last Friday to extend a strong rally in the first two months of 2024.\nThough the Fed and Chair Jerome Powell have pushed back on markets' rate-cut expectations, investors still cheering the prospect of easier monetary policy this year.\nLast week, bitcoin hit the highest level of 2024 at $47,565, and its sudden rebound after several weeks of anemic trading following the approval of the spot ETFs puts the coin back on track to reach $100,000 by year-end, according to analysts at Standard Chartered.\nWith the next bitcoin halving event approaching in April, investors are eyeing the next leg higher for the world's biggest crypto, with the prior three halvings pushing the token to new all-time highs in the following 12 months.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

Earlier, it sunk as low as $48,372.89. On Monday it punched through the $50,000 mark to its highest level in more than two years.\nTuesday's down move began when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a bigger increase in the January consumer price index than economists surveyed by Dow Jones anticipated. That report sent yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rising more than 10 basis points, and pressured risk assets.\n\"Bitcoin is an aspirational store of value ... and therefore its price is in part influenced by monetary policy,\" said Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity Investments' director of global macro. \"The CPI report came in hot and suggests that the Fed is further away from a pivot than was priced in. That suggests higher nominal and real rates for longer, which in theory diminishes the urgency to hold a store of value.\"\nNico Cordeiro, chief investment officer at Strix Leviathan, said he expects the crypto rally to continue despite Tuesday's pause.\n\"However,\" he added, \"investors should expect longer term weakness if inflation continues to run hotter than expected, which tends to run counter to the dominant belief that bitcoin is an inflation hedge — it is not, it's a gauge on liquidity within the financial system.\"\nThe crypto exchange Coinbase fell 4.7% and bitcoin proxy Microstrategy lost 4.39%. Miners trimmed earlier losses but remained under pressure. CleanSpark and Iris Energy were lower by less than 1% each after falling as much as 4%. Marathon Digital slid 5.72%, and Riot Platforms retreated by 3.02%.\nBitcoin remains above $48,600, a level being watched by investors and chart analysts. Multiple closes above it would support new highs above $50,000 and potentially an all-time high. The coin hit its record of $68,982.20 on Nov. 10, 2021.\nElsewhere, ether hovered at the flat line while Solana's SOL token gained 1.79%.\nYuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, noted that ether led the crypto rally on Monday when it rose 5.5% to its highest level in a month. He said the price has been buoyed by anticipation of Ethereum's next big tech upgrade in March, called Dencun, and renewed interest in NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, from the crypto community.\n\"The [bitcoin] price may be ripe for some minor correction within a week or so, but its upward trend will likely continue due to improved demand through ETFs and technical sentiment,\" he added.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","13th Feb, 2024. 07:32 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 5, 2024\nAs of February 13, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stands at $489,01.12.

Bitcoin hit its highest price since 2021 ($52,500Â as of Thursday), the SECâs approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has investors very excited, and the market cap for all crypto just breached $2 trillion.  But everyone whoâs ready to FOMO their way into crypto should ask themselves: Should we really be doing  this again?\nThe last time the crypto market was this hot was late 2021, and things were looking very rosy in the world of fake money. Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $69,000 and there were countless TV ads featuring celebrities hawking crypto. Super Bowl LVI played ads that now live in infamy with Larry David and LeBron James promoting FTX and Crypto.com respectively.\nMatt Damon even showed up on TVs early in the last big crypto hype cycle, premiering in October 2021 with an ad that insisted fortune favors the brave, just a month before Bitcoin would hit its all-time high. That ad would be widely ridiculed, but it helped set the stage for a lot of heartbreak as average, hard-working people got into what they thought was a good investment.\nThere are a lot of signs crypto history is about to repeat itself. Cryptoâs âfear and greed index,â maintained by Alternative.me, has reached its highest âgreedâ level since November 2021, as Coin Telegraph points out. And Peter Thielâs Founders Fund reportedly bought $200 million worth of crypto starting last summer and continued into the fall, according to Reuters. That means Thiel likely got in at a Bitcoin price of around $25,000, half of what it is today.\nShould you invest? Not with any money you canât afford to lose. Crypto is a Ponzi scheme. And you can run a Ponzi scheme as many times  as you like, as long as people are willing to hand over their money.  Crypto defenders will insist figures like Sam Bankman-Fried, the  convicted head of collapsed crypto company FTX, were just bad apples. SBF was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in a highly publicized trial that caused regular people to lose faith in crypto. But the reality is that the entire crypto enterprise is a house of cards. Nobody has yet delivered a great use case for crypto beyond buying drugs on the darknet or other highly illegal activities.\nIn fact, the U.S. Treasury Department just released a report on Tuesday about how popular crypto is with human traffickers and producers of child sexual exploitation material. Bitcoin is the digital currency of choice for the scum of the Earth. And it simply doesnât work well as a currency because of its highly volatile nature. Why would you spend Bitcoin to buy a pizza if your Bitcoin might double in price in a short span of time?\nBitcoin is such a shitty technology that stablecoins needed to be invented in order to effectively trade since the blockchain can only handle a fraction of the transactions that established financial networks like Visa can handle. Thatâs where SBF got into trouble since he paid an old FTX investor, Changpeng Zhao in FTXâs native token FTT. And when Zhao tried to cash out this tokenâwhich, again, was fake money created by FTXâit tipped over the first domino from which FTX never recovered.\nBut you donât need to take advice from me. Iâve been skeptical of cryptocurrency for years and still believe itâs way overvalued. But I also thought it was overvalued back in 2019 when the price of bitcoin was $5,000. If youâd bought at that price five years ago and held onto it without selling, youâd have ten times your money today.

But the public doesnât learn about the timing until well after the fact. If history is any guide, the price of Bitcoin is likely to soar in the near future, just as itâs on a steady uptick right now, causing a lot of people to buy at the peak. Thatâs when guys like Thiel will sell, just before the next inevitable crash.\nIf you think you can time the market and make some money on crypto, good for you. Make your money. But as bitcoinâs price potentially inches ever closer to that all-time high of $69,000 achieved in late 2021, most people are going to be stuck buying Thielâs overpriced bags and selling after another crash out of frustration. Thiel has probably already doubled his money with the current price of Bitcoin. And we wonât know for a long while when Thiel will exit his position.

Bitcoin just hit its highest price since 2021, the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has investors very excited, and the market cap for all crypto just breached $2 trillion.  But everyone who’s ready to FOMO their way into crypto should ask themselves: Should we really be doing  this again?\nThe last time the crypto market was this hot was late 2021, and things were looking very rosy in the world of fake money. Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $69,000 and there were countless TV ads featuring celebrities hawking crypto. Super Bowl LVI played ads that now live in infamy with Larry David and LeBron James promoting FTX and Crypto.com respectively.\nMatt Damon even showed up on TVs early in the last big crypto hype cycle, premiering in October 2021 with an ad that insisted fortune favors the brave, just a month before Bitcoin would hit its all-time high. That ad would be widely ridiculed, but it helped set the stage for a lot of heartbreak as average, hard-working people got into what they thought was a good investment.\nThere are a lot of signs crypto history is about to repeat itself. Crypto’s “fear and greed index,” maintained by Alternative.me, has reached its highest “greed” level since November 2021, as Coin Telegraph points out. And Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund reportedly bought $200 million worth of crypto starting last summer and continued into the fall, according to Reuters. That means Thiel likely got in at a Bitcoin price of around $25,000, half of what it is today.\nShould you invest? Not with any money you can’t afford to lose. Crypto is a Ponzi scheme. And you can run a Ponzi scheme as many times  as you like, as long as people are willing to hand over their money.  Crypto defenders will insist figures like Sam Bankman-Fried, the  convicted head of collapsed crypto company FTX, were just bad apples. SBF was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in a highly publicized trial that caused regular people to lose faith in crypto. But the reality is that the entire crypto enterprise is a house of cards. Nobody has yet delivered a great use case for crypto beyond buying drugs on the darknet or other highly illegal activities.\nIn fact, the U.S. Treasury Department just released a report on Tuesday about how popular crypto is with human traffickers and producers of child sexual exploitation material. Bitcoin is the digital currency of choice for the scum of the Earth. And it simply doesn’t work well as a currency because of its highly volatile nature. Why would you spend Bitcoin to buy a pizza if your Bitcoin might double in price in a short span of time?\nBitcoin is such a shitty technology that stablecoins needed to be invented in order to effectively trade since the blockchain can only handle a fraction of the transactions that established financial networks like Visa can handle. That’s where SBF got into trouble since he paid an old FTX investor, Changpeng Zhao in FTX’s native token FTT. And when Zhao tried to cash out this token—which, again, was fake money created by FTX—it tipped over the first domino from which FTX never recovered.\nBut you don’t need to take advice from me. I’ve been skeptical of cryptocurrency for years and still believe it’s way overvalued. But I also thought it was overvalued back in 2019 when the price of bitcoin was $5,000.

This surge was fuelled by continuous inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provided crucial support to Bitcoin prices. On Wednesday, Bitcoin’s value soared to $51,606, marking a 25-month high with a 4.1 per cent increase for the day. This surge propelled Bitcoin’s market capitalization to $1.005 trillion, according to data from Coingecko. However, it’s worth noting that the all-time high for Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.28 trillion, reached in November 2021. Since the beginning of February, Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable uptick of around 20 per cent, poised to record its most significant monthly rise since October. Notably, Bitcoin investments constitute over half of the $2.01 trillion invested in the overall cryptocurrency market, which encompasses other digital assets like Ether. Analysts attribute much of the recent price action to strong inflows into newly listed US ETFs. Data from LSEG Lipper indicates that capital flows into 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs surged to $1.64 billion in the week leading up to Wednesday. Over the past five trading sessions alone, these products attracted $409 million in inflows, following their regulatory approval and subsequent trading launch in January. Analysts from B2C2, a crypto liquidity provider, highlighted the correlation between price movements and capital flows in the cryptocurrency market. They anticipate that if the current pace continues, substantial inflows will likely drive further price appreciation for spot Bitcoin. In tandem with Bitcoin’s rally, shares of US-listed cryptocurrency firms experienced pre-market gains on Wednesday. Notable mentions include Coinbase, which saw a 7 per cent increase, while mining companies like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark surged nearly 9 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. Bitcoin’s journey has been tumultuous, with its all-time high of $69,000 achieved in November 2021 followed by a period of struggle throughout 2022 and the early part of 2023. Factors such as global central banks’ monetary tightening and notable failures within the crypto industry, including those at leading exchanges like FTX, contributed to this turbulence. However, recent months have seen renewed optimism fueled by hopes of a soft economic landing and the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs, hailed as a game-changer for the industry, offer investors exposure to Bitcoin without the need to directly hold the asset. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also experienced a surge, reaching $2,742, its highest level since May 2022. This upward momentum underscores the broader bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market, driven by both Bitcoin’s resurgence and favourable market conditions. (With inputs from agencies)"]}

The Bitcoin outlook from most experts seems very positive for the remainder of 2024.\nThe trouble for investors who’ve yet to join the cryptocurrency club is whether their FOMO (fear of missing out) is warranted or merely an irrational thought.\nHelping move things along for the world’s leading cryptocurrency are the 10+ bitcoin ETFs launched in mid-January. The first month of trading for these ETFs saw inflows of approximately $125 million… a day.\nAs Coindesk points out, all these new bitcoin ETFs brought in more than $11 billion, offset partly by a $6 billion outflow from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA:GBTC).  As of Feb. 15, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) has managed to gather more than $5.6 billion in net assets.\nThe general consensus is that once institutional money management jumps into the bitcoin ETF fray, demand will be good, but not spectacular. Once the major wealth management platforms join in,\n“As firms begin covering the name, putting portfolio strategists to work determining allocations for different investor bases, the inflows are likely to exceed any ETF product before it,” Coindesk reported comments from Matt Sheffield, senior vice president of trading at FalconX, a large institutional digital assets broker.\nWith this step in the crypto journey yet to fully materialize and the general outlook for Bitcoin reasonably healthy, now would be a good time to buy if you’re bullish about the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory.\nHere’s why.\nI’d be a liar if I said I knew the Bitcoin price in a year. I can’t even predict the 12-month price target for a company with reliable earnings. Predicting the future price of Bitcoin has always been a mug’s game, and yet so many do it.\nUSA Today covered the subject in late January. Numbers thrown out ranged from $70,000 to $148,000. However, some of the estimates extend beyond 2024. The authors were quick to point out that investors were wise to consider whether Bitcoin was a wise long-term investment for them rather than the near-term price in the next 12 months.\nThis is a smart recommendation, given that Bitcoin has no real purpose other than as a store of value. But I digress.\nCNBC did a nice little roundup at the end of 2023. Their expert sources provided predictions varying from $60,000 to $500,000. It seems like a sure thing to make money on in 2024.\nI like veteran portfolio manager Mark Mobius’ comments about his $60,000 prediction.\n“‘No rationale for that prediction,’ Mobius said, except that a bitcoin ETF looks likely and ‘that has heightened interest’ in the cryptocurrency,” CNBC reported.\nHe’s 100% right. There is no fundamental reason for BTC to hit $60,000 by Dec. 31, other than the added interest caused by the new ETFs. When you think about it, with a finite supply and a halving in April, investors are rearranging the deck chairs, artificially pushing up demand.\nMoving to the high-end of predictions, the venture capital firm CoinFund predicts BTC will hit somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2024.\n“Bitcoin has a strong inverse correlation with the dollar and real yields, and both are now going down,” Seth Ginns, managing partner at CoinFund, told CNBC via email.\nWhile you have to question the realistic nature of the prediction — Bitcoin has never traded over $65,000 in its history — at least Ginns provided a rational explanation why it might move higher over the next 10 months.\nWhile price predictions are all over the map, there is no question that three things play into the eventual winner: the growth of bitcoin ETF net assets, the April halving, and lower interest rates. If all three of those positively impact demand, its November 2021 all-time high could be tested before New Year’s.\nI’ve always disliked the idea of a Bitcoin outlook racket for cryptocurrencies. It’s so random given the lack of fundamental research available. The reverse of that, however, is that bitcoin and bitcoin mining very much resembles gold and gold mining, and you don’t hear much skepticism in the investment community these days around gold price predictions. It’s become standard fare.\nWarren Buffett once said that if you added up all the gold in the world, it would amount to a cube 67 feet on a side. You’d have it in your backyard and all you could do with it is stare at it. Absolutely no utility.\nAnd we know what the late Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, thought about Bitcoin.\n“I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth. Nor do I like shuffling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air,” Benzinga reported Munger’s past comments after his passing in November.\nTwo of the smartest men to walk the planet took issue with Bitcoin. If you’re going to focus your attention on price predictions, you probably shouldn’t own the cryptocurrency.\nHaving said that, the tea leaves point to a strong year for bitcoin in 2024.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time. He lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Tea Leaves Suggest BTC Could Zoom Past $65K in 2024 appeared first on InvestorPlace.","This article was published more than 1 year ago. Some information may no longer be current.\nCoinbase Global COIN-Q on Thursday posted its first quarterly profit since 2021 on sturdy trading volumes due to a resurgence of interest in crypto, sending its shares up nearly 13 per cent after the bell.\nInvestor enthusiasm for crypto was rekindled in recent months by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) highly anticipated approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nWhile the ETFs were approved only in January, expectations of a favourable decision by the SEC propelled bitcoin’s price 57 per cent higher in the last three months of 2023.\nThat drove a 64 per cent jump in crypto exchange Coinbase’s transaction revenue to $529.3-million in the fourth quarter.\n“Results this quarter were exceptional as they far exceeded both our expectations and Street consensus,” said Michael Elliott, equity research analyst with CFRA Research.\nThe crypto exchange now expects a strong first quarter for its subscription and services unit, which houses businesses other than trading.\nIt forecast revenue from the unit between $410-million and $480-million, higher than LSEG estimate of $356.22-million.\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue from the unit jumped nearly 33 per cent to $375.4-million, with the biggest boost coming from stablecoin revenue – the interest that Coinbase earns from its partnership with fintech firm Circle.\nCircle issues the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin that it jointly governs with Coinbase. The interest on reserves backing USDC are a major source of revenue for Coinbase, which has been able to pocket higher income because of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.\nOverall, the company reported a profit of $273.4-million, or $1.04 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $557-million, or $2.46 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a loss of 1 cent per share, according to LSEG data.\nElliott said he had longer-term concerns that “the spot ETFs may lead more investors to look for crypto exposure off the Coinbase platform.”\nBut the company brushed aside such concerns.\n“ETFs have just been net positive for the industry and additive to Coinbase,” CFO Alesia Haas said.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following."]}

It launched in July after spending years in development and promised a solution to one of the more pressing problems recent advances in artificial intelligence poses online: verifying someone’s identity. Worldcoin’s solution is to give users a unique digital identity when they verify themselves in the real world with an in-person eye scan administered by a silver orb. By scanning irises, Worldcoin should only allocate one digital identity per person, which would be stored on the blockchain. The crypto tokens are part of a broader ambition to use its user credential system to tap into booming interest in decentralized finance and scanners were given tokens for signing up. The scheme has faced some problems rolling out, including data privacy concerns in Kenya and regulatory hurdles and waning interest in countries like India, France and Brazil. Orbs have also reportedly had difficulty scanning the eyes of Asian people. Worldcoin is attempting to solve a problem that Altman’s other venture, Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is potentially playing a leading role in bringing about. The sophistication of its generative AI tools, such as image and text generators Dall-E and ChatGPT, provoke questions over the authenticity of content that is produced and spread online. Sora is one of many increasingly advanced products capable of turning text prompts into ever more realistic videos and experts fear it could create convincing deepfakes and false content that would easily spread online. Concerns are particularly acute during an already intense election year and OpenAI has said Sora is being tested for safety and will not be released to the public until potential issues over its malicious use are addressed.\n$2.09 trillion. That’s how much Forbes estimates the total cryptocurrency market is worth. The value of the market has grown around 2% in the last 24 hours. Last week was the first time the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market crossed the $2 trillion threshold since early 2022.\nWorldcoin’s growth follows a bumper week for crypto prices. Bitcoin, which makes up almost half of the total cryptocurrency market’s value by capitalization, was trading at $52.36 as of writing, up 9% from a week ago. The second-most-valuable token ether, which is on the Ethereum network, was up 17% over the same time period. Other leading cryptocurrencies by market value—including tether (USDT), Binance’s BNB, Solana’s sol, Ripple’s XRP, Cardano’s ada and meme token dogecoin—were also up between 6% and 17% over the last seven days. The crypto market, whose value briefly exceeded $3 trillion in late 2021, is still recovering from crashes precipitated by a series of high profile failures and scandals starting towards the end of that year. This included the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange and the executive’s subsequent arrest, the collapse of crypto institutions like lender Celsius and investor Three Arrows Capital and stablecoins like Tether and terraUSD (UST)—supported by token luna—slipping their $1 pegs, with the latter network erasing billions in value when it collapsed."]}

It is also the home of Bit Brother.\nThe China-based company focused on selling tea products until it pivoted to cryptocurrencies in 2021. Its shares have fallen more than 99% since the beginning of 2020, after accounting for the three reverse stock splits it has done.\nBit Brother drew little notice until late December when its trading volume surged to billions of shares a day for no clear reason. Volume in Bit Brother hit 3.5 billion shares, or 28% of all the shares that changed hands in the U.S. stock market, on Dec. 27. The stock was trading for about a penny a share, so the value of those trades was small. On Jan. 10, Bit Brother did an unusual 1,000-for-1 reverse split, which helped the company maintain its Nasdaq listing by getting its stock back above $1.\nIt has become increasingly common for stocks with a low share price to experience huge bursts of trading volume. Fueling these frenzies are individual investors who use zero-commission trading tools to pile into stocks that get buzz on social media.\nWhen such stocks trade for pennies a share, it is easy for day traders to place enormous bets on them. Then the high volumes themselves become a source of buzz, with the stocks appearing on leaderboards of heavily traded stocks where other investors take their cues.\nA growing number of market veterans say something is broken—and they point the finger at Nasdaq, the listing exchange for most smaller public companies.\nNasdaq rules require companies to be delisted if their share price falls below $1 for an extended period of time. But the grace period before delisting can last more than a year. And some companies, like Bit Brother, repeatedly do reverse splits to stay listed.\n“These sub-dollar, high-volume stocks make a mockery of our stock market,\" said Joe Saluzzi, a partner at New Jersey-based brokerage Themis Trading. “The primary listing market, in most cases Nasdaq, needs to tighten up their standards and reduce the amount of time needed for a delisting.\"\nCritics such as Saluzzi say Nasdaq faces a conflict of interest: The exchange makes money by listing companies, while running a regulatory arm that delists companies when they don’t follow the rules.\n“At Nasdaq, our regulatory functions operate independently of Nasdaq’s business units to safeguard the integrity of our markets,\" a spokesman for the exchange said.\nBeing listed on an exchange is effectively a seal of approval for a company. Major brokerages generally allow customers to trade any stock listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, while restricting access to the over-the-counter market, a sort of purgatory where companies land after they get delisted.\nDays after the Bit Brother frenzy eased, volumes exploded in Phunware, a software developer that developed an app for Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. This past Jan. 16, after Trump won Iowa’s 2024 Republican caucuses, Phunware’s stock price more than quintupled to 42 cents, and 1.6 billion of its shares changed hands—accounting for 12% of total market volume that day.\nPhunware’s stock has been stuck below $1 for the past year. A spokeswoman said the company would do a reverse split, if needed, to comply with Nasdaq listing rules.\nThe number of sub-$1 stocks has swelled as many of the companies that went public during the era of rock-bottom interest rates—often via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs—have struggled. As of Thursday, there were 493 stocks that closed below $1, the majority of them listed on Nasdaq, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In early 2021, fewer than a dozen stocks were trading below $1 a share.\n“Historically, these companies would have been delisted and gone to the OTC market,\" said Ovi Montemayor, a managing director at Charles Schwab.\nReverse splits have grown more common as such companies have sought to boost their share price above $1. There were 495 reverse splits of exchange-listed stocks in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That was up from 288 the year before and marked the largest annual total in the two decades since S&P began recording such data. In reverse splits, companies swap multiple shares for one share, artificially boosting the price of a single share.\nThe flurry of reverse splits has caused headaches for some brokers. In December 2022, a tiny pharmaceutical company called Cosmos Health approved a 25-for-1 reverse split and executed it the next day. The move led to a processing error at Robinhood Markets, which said it lost $57 million, blaming the snafu on delayed notifications about the split. Fallout from Cosmos Health’s reverse split caused losses at other brokers, including Schwab, people familiar with the matter said.\nAfter the debacle, firms including Robinhood and Schwab met repeatedly with Nasdaq to urge improvements in the handling of reverse splits, the people said. Late last year, Nasdaq implemented a rule change requiring companies to publicly disclose reverse splits at least two business days before the splits take effect.\nSome market veterans say big bursts of activity in sub-$1 stocks lead to a distorted picture of total market volume. Unlike many other countries, the U.S. measures stock-market volume in terms of number of shares traded, rather than their value. So when cheap stocks like Bit Brother trade over a billion shares a day, it inflates volume data for the market as a whole.\n“Notional volume and share volume are kind of growing apart,\" said Anna Kurzrok, head of market structure at Jefferies. “On any given day, volume and value traded can be very different things.\"\nBit Brother didn’t respond to a request for comment. Its website greets visitors with the grammatically challenged message: “Infinite blockchain make future simpler.\"\nThe company could finally be booted off Nasdaq soon. This month, Bit Brother disclosed that Nasdaq was planning to delist it because of “public interest concerns\" about two of the company’s recent share offerings. The company is set to appeal the decision at a hearing next week. Until then, Bit Brother will still be listed on Nasdaq.\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Bitcoin is still a long con.\nAnalysts at ECB described last month's approval of bitcoin ETFs as \"the naked emperor's new clothes\" in a blog post on Thursday, reiterating their long-standing view that the cryptocurrency has no real value and is likely the cause of more problems than it solves.\nThose problems include environmental damage and the redistribution of wealth to the detriment of those who may have less understanding of the market.\n\"For disciples, the formal approval confirms that Bitcoin investments are safe and the preceding rally is proof of an unstoppable triumph. We disagree with both claims and reiterate that the fair value of Bitcoin is still zero,\" the ECB's Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf said in the blog post, warning investors of an unruly reinflating of the \"bitcoin bubble.\"\nThe ECB experts said bitcoin falls short in generating cash flow or other value-based returns, making it a poor investment. Crowing cybercrime activity that exploits the anonymity of digital currency further erodes its potential use case as an everyday payment method. Moreover, bitcoin mining through the proof-of-work mechanism continues to pose environmental concerns.\n\"Alas, all these risks have materialized,\" the note said.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light for 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The investment vehicles have been touted an easier entry point for investors to gain exposure to the world's largest crypto, and helped propel the total cryptocurrency market cap to $2 trillion for the first time since April 2022.\n\"For society, a renewed boom-bust cycle of Bitcoin is a dire perspective. And the collateral damage will be massive, including the environmental damage and the ultimate redistribution of wealth at the expense of the less sophisticated,\" they wrote.\nBindseil and Schaaf attributed the bitcoin craze to the unbridled price manipulation, the surge in demand for the \"currency of crime,\" and authorities grappling with how to police the space. They added that expected rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year and the upcoming halving event would add fuel to the rally.\n\"Still, this could turn out to be a flash in the pan. While in the short run the inflowing money can have a large impact on prices irrespective of fundamentals, prices will eventually return to their fundamental values in the long run,\" they wrote in the note.\n\"Detached from economic fundamentals every price is equally (im)plausible – a fantastic condition for snake oil salesmen.\"\nThe officials also called on authorities to keep their guard up when it comes to monitoring bitcoin-related crime, saying that \"this job has not been done yet.\"\n\"The 'market' capitalisation quantifies the overall social damage that will occur when the house of cards collapses.\"\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

However, our MARA stock analysis is bullish and cryptocurrency enthusiasts should conduct their due diligence on Marathon Digital.\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a more active Bitcoin miner than Marathon Digital. Furthermore, Marathon Digital has a profitable profile, so this isn’t some fly-by-night operation. Overall, Marathon Digital stock earns an “A” grade and, for some investors, could be an appropriate alternative to Bitcoin ETFs.\nWhen The Wall Street Journal is talking about cryptocurrency, it must be big news. And indeed, it’s a big deal that Bitcoin’s market capitalization recently surpassed the $1 trillion threshold.\nAs you’ve surely figured out by now, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has spurred large-scale investments into the crypto space and helped to catalyze the Bitcoin price. This doesn’t mean you have to pour your investable capital into these ETFs, however.\nAs Bitcoin’s market cap swells, you might not want to buy a financial product that probably charges a fee (typically called an “expense ratio”). You may prefer to own an asset that moves faster than Bitcoin but generally in the same direction.\nMARA stock fits the bill handily. For the foreseeable future, as long as the cryptocurrency space grows, there will be a need for Bitcoin miners. So now, let’s talk about Marathon Digital’s mining activity, which should impress even the most discerning cryptocurrency investors.\nFirst and foremost, we should mention that Marathon Digital posted a profit in its most recently reported quarter. Specifically, the company disclosed net income of $64.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nThat same quarter, Wall Street expected Marathon Digital to report an earnings loss of 11 cents per share. Yet, the company actually had income – not a loss – of 38 cents per share in Q3 2023.\nOn an operational level, Marathon Digital is also demonstrating that it’s an active and legitimate business. In December of last year, Marathon Digital produced 1,853 Bitcoin, up 290% year over year.\nThen, in January of this year, Marathon Digital produced 1,084 Bitcoin, up 58% YOY. Granted, every month will involve different circumstances and varying production numbers. Marathon Digital’s growth as a premier Bitcoin producer is undeniable.\nMarathon Digital stock is up substantially over the past year. Meanwhile, the approved spot Bitcoin ETFs are still new, but it’s safe to assume that they will perform approximately the same as Bitcoin, minus any fees.\nOur MARA stock analysis suggests that greater gains could come when compared to just holding Bitcoin ETFs. Of course, greater potential rewards will involve a certain measure of risk, so keep proper position sizing in mind. Still, since Marathon Digital is highly active and was income-positive in 2023’s third quarter, we’re assigning the stock an “A” grade today.\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\nThe post MARA Stock Analysis: Why Marathon Digital May Be a Better Bitcoin Bet appeared first on InvestorPlace.","23rd Feb, 2024. 04:50 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 5, 2024\nAs of February 23, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stands at $51,220.90.

It last traded at this level in December 2021, and reached an all-time high of almost $69,000 the prior month.\nInvestors have poured more than $5 billion into nine ETFs that began trading last month. That figure takes into account the $7.4 billion that has been withdrawn during the same period from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted from a trust.\n“Bitcoin is approaching new yearly highs off the back of increased spot demand and momentum traders taking positions off the back of a breakout after a week of consolidation,” said Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs. “Interestingly enough, liquidations are not too excessive for the current price action, and shorts who were liquidated were quickly replaced with leveraged longs.”\nThe open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts, for perpetual Bitcoin futures has seen a noticeable increase, Newhouse said. At the same time, short positions have been forced to be closed in the latest rally. That may be the result of fresh long positions in the market, he said.\nAdding to the optimism around Bitcoin was another large purchase of the tokens by MicroStrategy Inc. The enterprise software firm, which has made buying Bitcoin as part of its corporate strategy, said Monday that it purchased another 3,000 or so of the cryptocurrency tokens this month for $155.4 million. It owns about $10 billion in Bitcoin.\nShares of MicroStrategy jumped around 14%, while other crypto-relate stocks also rallied. Coinbase Global rose 14% and Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital jumped almost 20%.\nOther cryptocurrencies followed suit, with tokens for Solana and Poly each rising more than 5%. Ether, the second-biggest digial asset, gained about 2%.\n--With assistance from Muyao Shen.\n(An earlier update corrected the percentage change in the third paragraph.)\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nCatch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

It’s actually a great time to invest, as today’s MARA stock analysis points to significantly higher prices this year.\nGranted, there’s an upcoming event that might make some cryptocurrency-miner stock traders nervous. Don’t worry, though, as Marathon Digital stock can rally throughout 2024. History shows that just HODL—Holding On for Dear Life—is your best strategy to ride out any crypto-market volatility.\nSo, here’s what might cause some folks to lose sleep at night. There’s a Bitcoin halving event coming up in April. This means that Bitcoin miners’ reward for their mining activity will be cut in half soon.\nMuch like the Olympics, Bitcoin-halving events happen approximately once every four years. The idea is to reduce the supply of Bitcoin and thereby keep the Bitcoin price high. That’s a net positive for Marathon Digital, which benefits from higher Bitcoin prices in the long run.\nStill, some traders might worry about Marathon Digital stock coming under pressure in the Bitcoin’s wake halving event. Let’s look at the last time this occurred, though.\nReportedly, MARA stock rallied from 76 cents on May 11, 2020 (the most recent Bitcoin halving event), to $2.14 on Oct. 28, 2020. That’s a 182% gain in just 150 days. Yes, that’s just one example, but it shows that Bitcoin halving events don’t result in negative pressure on the Marathon Digital share price.\nMarathon Digital has an enormous Bitcoin hoard. In fact, the company had 15,741 Bitcoins as of Jan. 31.\nMarathon Digital is making a smart move by assuming full control of the company’s Bitcoin-mining operations. Specifically, Marathon Digital entered into an agreement to remove rival cryptocurrency miner Hut8 (NASDAQ:HUT) as the operator of two Bitcoin-mining sites that Marathon Digital recently acquired.\nThere are direct benefits for Marathon Digital. First, the company “expects to reduce its operating fees, thereby improving its cost to produce” Bitcoin. Second, Marathon can “more effectively participate in energy hedging and other energy management services.” Moreover, the company will be able to “streamline the implementation of its proprietary technology to improve operational efficiency.”\nBelieve it or not, a thorough MARA stock analysis shows that it can actually rally after a Bitcoin halving event. Plus, Marathon Digital, with its sizable Bitcoin hoard, will benefit from taking full control of its Bitcoin-mining operations.\nAll of this adds up to a powerful bull case for Marathon Digital stock, but you need to get on board today to build your wealth in 2024. Otherwise, you’ll only end up investing in Marathon Digital at higher share prices. So, cryptocurrency enthusiasts can either take action now or miss out on the rally and regret it later.\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Since September 2022, bitcoin's volatility has been below its long-term average. Even the recent launch of spot ETF products hasn't resulted in a meaningful spike in its price churn.\nThe chart below shows the token's trailing 100-day standard deviation of daily returns dating back to 2015.\n\"The numbers here reflect how much [Bitcoin] typically moves in percentage points on any given day over these rolling windows,\" Colas and Rabe said. \"We have noted the average of 3.5 points with a dotted black line.\"\nUnique to bitcoin, however, is its history of regularly touching highs and lows during stretches of above-average volatility. For example, from December 2017 to March 2019 the asset hit a then-record high of $19,000 and also crashed to $8,000. Several other occasions in the last several years have brought similar swings.\nStocks, meanwhile, tend to touch lows during above-average volatility, but they reach new highs during times of low volatility, according to DataTrek.\nThe data show that bitcoin indeed has been more stable than usual over the last 18 months, despite still being more than twice as volatile as US large-cap stocks.\n\"Greater levels of institutional interest may be dampening [bitcoin's] daily price moves,\" Colas and Rabe said. \"Simply put, [bitcoin] may finally be growing up. We have been waiting many years to see this development, and it may now be occurring.\"\nIt's possible a more stable bitcoin could entice investors to increase their asset allocation.\nIt's true too, though, that lower volatility could send some retail investors back into stocks, in the firm's view.\n\"Over the last 3 years, many individuals started their trading and investing lives focused on virtual currencies like [bitcoin],\" DataTrek's cofounders said. \"Now that volatility is lower than usual, they might shift capital into spicier single stocks where daily returns give them a chance at short term gains.\"\nMeanwhile, crypto investors have been bracing for the halving event, expected in April, which will cut the amount of bitcoin rewarded to miners in half. Some strategists have used halving to justify six-figure price forecasts, pointing to the token making new all-time highs in the 12 months following the prior three halving events.\nIn 2024, bitcoin has climbed about 16.1% to hover at about $51,309. It's up 118% in the last 12 months, and was trading at $51,935 on Monday morning.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

The crypto coin exceeded US$57,000 for the first time since November 2021.\nThe climb in price comes from a number of factors, ranging from institutional buying and optimism about regulations to overall positive market sentiment.\nStill, it’s far off from the all-time highs we saw before when many believe it was headed for US$100,000. Plus, it’s expensive, as you can tell. So, in this case, it might be time to consider more diversified options. And these are the three I’d consider if you’re looking at investing in cryptocurrency stocks on the TSX today.\nIf you want direct Bitcoin exposure from your cryptocurrency stocks, then I’d look at Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC). The exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers exposure to Bitcoin, with other possible advantages as well. This includes no need for a crypto wallet, unlike buying Bitcoin, eliminating technical complexities.\nThere are also tax benefits, and investors can hold it in their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), for instance. So, you can save it from being taxed, unlike Bitcoin. Furthermore, there is the potential for diversification. Investors can easily add this Bitcoin ETF to their TFSA at a $73 share price. Investors can also afford to diversify to other areas of cryptocurrency stocks as well.\nSo, if you believe there is a strong future with Bitcoin, then this is likely the way to go, with the ETF climbing right alongside the crypto coin.\nIf you want indirect exposure to Bitcoin, I would suggest going with cryptocurrency stocks involved with mining. For that, look at Hut 8 Mining (TSX:HUT). The stock has unique advantages, as it holds direct exposure from mining crypto. So, if Bitcoin does well, so too does Hut stock. There is also the potential for leverage, however, amplifying the price movements from mining more of the crypto coin.\nWhat’s more, Hut stock doesn’t only invest in Bitcoin but other cryptocurrency stocks as well. So, let’s say there are direct issues with Bitcoin in the future. The company could still do well from its investments in other types of cryptocurrency stocks and coins.\nFurthermore, Hut stock has been doing well but is still cheap! The stock trades at $12.65, which is now up 12% in the last year alone. And that’s again still down from 52-week highs this year. So, if you want exposure to multiple types of cryptocurrency, this is the one I’d go for.\nFinally, if you want exposure to the overall cryptocurrency space and stocks involved, Galaxy Digital Holdings (TSX:GLXY) is an easy option. It offers indirect exposure to Bitcoin but has no direct investment in Bitcoin itself.\nThe company has diversified exposure through a wider range of cryptocurrency as well as blockchain-related businesses. This includes venture capitalist investments, crypto trading, and other financial products. This helps mitigate overall risk for cryptocurrency stocks.\nThe company has a deep knowledge of cryptocurrency and the space, with professional managers in charge. Similar to Hut stock, it can help amplify the movement of Bitcoin with more investment in their products as Bitcoin climbs higher.\nShares are no dup 196% in the last year alone! So, clearly, the interest is there, with many believing the company is coming back from the ashes. Therefore, if Bitcoin continues to climb, it’s one of the cryptocurrency stocks I’d latch onto.\nApril 17, 2025 |\n        Amy Legate-Wolfe\nThis Canadian stock may not be the first you think of when hearing \"AI stock,\" but it should be.\nRead more »\nApril 16, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nShopify and Magellan are two top TSX stocks you can buy right now and generate outsized gains in the upcoming…\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Joey Frenette\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands out as a top Mag Seven stock for Canadian investors to buy amid tariff fears.\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nBlackBerry is a TSX tech stock that is positioned to underperform the broader markets in the near term.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a reading of 115 for February.\nInvestors digested other economic updates on Tuesday, including another rise in home prices and the largest drop in US durable goods orders in four years.\nBy contrast, the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to two-year highs, breaking above $57,000 per token, with gains buoyed by a big investment from MicroStrategy (MSTR). Shares of bitcoin miners and crypto exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) rose alongside the leading digital currency.\nEarly morning earnings reports from major retailers provided a window into how the consumer is faring. Macy's (M) shares slipped as it revealed plans to shutter 150 stores in a turnaround bid and reported another quarter of sales. Lowe's (LOW) downbeat 2024 sales and profit outlook weighed on the home improvement chain's stock.\nStocks closed mixed on Tuesday following a retreat from all-time highs.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down just below 0.3% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) picked up some late trading momentum to finish the day around 0.2% higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the major indices, closing up roughly 0.4%.\nAppetite for home improvement projects will likely be sluggish this year, but there are good reasons to expect the slump will be temporary, according to the home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW).\n\"When you hear these factors with trends like chronic undersupply of homes, millennial household formation, baby boomers aging in place, and a sustained number of people working from home — you can see why we are confident that home improvement demand will trend upwards over time across both homeowners and Pros,” Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison said on the company's fiscal fourth quarter earnings call Tuesday.\nLowe’s reported comparable sales were down 6.2% in the quarter that ended Feb. 2, driven by continued pressure from do-it-yourself customers holding off spending on bigger ticket items. Lowe’s forecast comparable sales to be down by 2% to 3% for the full year 2024.\nSales of previously occupied homes remain at a historic low, mortgage rates continue to hover around 7%, and home prices haven't cooled, discouraging many from moving or selling.\nEllison said that due to such factors, the company expects DIY demand to be under pressure in the near term. The other part of this equation is the timeline of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, which could boost the housing market and, in turn, big-ticket purchases at Lowe's.\n“While there is increased confidence of a soft landing, there's still a lot of speculation on the timing of anticipated interest rate cuts in the face of slowing inflation,” Ellison said. “It's also unclear how quickly the consumer will react to these changes and how quickly their spending habits will change.”\nSome Wall Street analysts aren’t holding their breath that the demand for home improvement will bounce back this year amid higher mortgage rates and a pullback in new construction projects.\n“Not 2024, maybe the second half of 2024,” D.A.

Microsoft (MSFT) has gained about 8% this year, slightly outperforming the benchmark's average return of just more than 6%. And then there's Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA), whose stocks have lost value through about two months of trade in 2024.\nThe performance marks a clear divergence in what had been a story of seven \"Magnificent\" tech stocks leading the benchmark average higher in 2023.\nDataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe reasoned the outperformance seen in Nvidia, Meta, and to some extent, Amazon makes sense when considering recent moves in earnings projections.

The biopharmaceutical giant said the drug demonstrated \"statistically significant reductions in body weight at all doses as compared to placebo.\"\nJanux Therapeutics (JANX): Shares of the biotech stock tripled in value on Tuesday, rising more than 200% after the company revealed promising early clinical trial results for its prostate cancer treatment. The results show \"promising efficacy with favorable safety profile in heavily pretreated subjects with late-stage [prostate cancer],\" the company said.\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH): Shares rose more than 15% on Tuesday after the cruise liner reported its first profitable year since 2019 as fourth quarter losses narrowed significantly. The company also posted upbeat guidance for the current quarter in addition to full-year guidance that matched Wall Street expectations.\nUnity Software (U): Shares fell nearly 10% on Tuesday, its largest drop in a year, after the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and also reported a higher-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter. The disappointing results come after the company announced a strategic reset of its portfolio.\nShares of Hess (HES) and Chevron (CVX) slumped on Tuesday after their planned merger hit a snag.\nOil giant ExxonMobil (XOM) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) said they are considering pre-emption rights related to their project in Guyana, a key asset in Chevron’s planned acquisition of Hess.\nExxonMobil is the operator of the project and owns a 45% stake, while CNOOC owns 25%. Hess owns the other 30%, which was expected to be transferred to Chevron once the merger closes.\nExxonMobil said in a statement: \"We owe it to our investors and partners to consider our pre-emption rights in place under our joint operating agreement to ensure we preserve our right to realize the significant value we’ve created and are entitled to in the Guyana asset.\"\nIn an SEC filing, Chevron stated it has been “engaged in constructive discussions” with ExxonMobil, CNOOC, and Hess.\n“Chevron and Hess believe these discussions will result in an outcome that will not delay, impede or prevent the consummation of the merger,\" stated Chevron.\nLast year the oil major announced plans to acquire US explorer and producer Hess in an all-stock deal valued at $53 billion.\nThe Hess acquisition would give Chevron 30% ownership of more than 11 billion barrels-equivalent of recoverable resources in Guyana. The small country located in South America next to Venezuela is on track to produce more than 1 million barrels per day by 2026.\nShares of Hess slumped more than 3%, while Chevron dipped about 2%.\nUS stocks were stuck in a holding pattern on Tuesday after a pullback from all-time highs.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped more than 0.1%.

Ether (ETH-USD) topped $3,200 for the first time since 2022, while shares of Coinbase (COIN) rose about 3%.\nBitcoin has gained nearly 35% so far in February. If current levels hold, it will be the token's largest one-month gain since January 2023.\nThe weight-loss trade is alive and well on Wall Street.\nShares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) rose as much as 70% early Tuesday after the company reported a phase II trial of its weight-loss treatment reached its primary and secondary endpoints.\nThe trial showed its weight-loss treatment, VK2735, which is \"a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors,\" saw patients lose up to a placebo-adjusted 13.1% of their body weight after 13 weeks.\nThe company will now meet with the FDA to discuss the next steps in development.\nViking stock has risen sixfold over the last year, and the company's market cap is now closing in on $7 billion.\nElsewhere on Tuesday, shares of Fractyl Health (GUTS) rose as much as 6% after Bank of America initiated coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a $26 price target.\nShares of Fractyl are down about 50% since their public debut earlier this month.\nFractyl is developing diabetes and obesity treatments as the pharmaceutical industry continues to rush toward the opportunity unlocked by Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY).\n\"We initiate coverage on Fractyl with a Buy and $26 PO,\" BofA wrote in its note.\n\"GUTS is a pre-commercial stage, hybrid medtech\/biopharma company that develops treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity.

January's preliminary reading was 114, a two-year high for the measure. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a reading of 115 for February.\nThe Expectations Index, which measures consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions, fell to 79.8 in February from a revised 81.5 in January. Historically, a reading below 80 in that category signals a recession in the coming year.\n\"The decline in consumer confidence in February interrupted a three-month rise, reflecting persistent uncertainty about the US economy,\" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board.\n“The drop in confidence was broad-based, affecting all income groups except households earning less than $15,000 and those earning more than $125,000. Confidence deteriorated for consumers under the age of 35 and those 55 and over, whereas it improved slightly for those aged 35 to 54,\" she added.\nUS stocks were mostly muted in early trading on Tuesday as investors digested a slew of retail earnings reports and awaited upcoming PCE inflation data, due Thursday.\nBoth the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) were little changed in the wake of a pullback from all-time highs. Tech stocks were more upbeat, with a rise of 0.3% for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\nJust wow, Macy's (M).\nIn an effort to fend off an overthrowing of its board by activist investor Arkhouse (who has nominated nine directors to the board), Macy's dropped a bombshell this morning: It plans to close 150 \"underproductive\" stores, with 50 shutting down this year.\nThe goal is to boost profit margins and cash flow and, potentially, push the stock price higher.\nThis is a huge, huge number for a company that has shuttered hundreds of stores across the country in the past decade.\nI will push to the side on what this could mean to the battle with Arkhouse for now.\nBut what I will say is that this is likely bullish for the general merchandise departments at discounters Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and TJX Companies (TJX) long term. Essentially, Macy's is exiting a fresh round of neighborhoods in the United States and, in turn, sending market share to competitors both in stores and online.\nI think the closures say a lot about how the shift to digital shopping continues to impact legacy retailers such as Macy's.\nBy the way, Amazon (AMZN) naturally is a winner here. It has made great strides in apparel and general merchandise selections, and considering it continues to cut delivery times, expect the tech beast to continue to put major pressure on department store retailers.\nThe vibe around the US housing market still isn't pretty and likely won't be any better until later this year.\nAppliance giant Whirlpool (WHR) just dropped some guidance ahead of an investor day down at the New York Stock Exchange today that says a lot about the continued pressures in the market.\nDespite a major innovation push this year (notably an aggressive push into new small appliances, such as automated KitchenAid espresso makers) the company guided to flat sales in North America year over year.\nThe company doesn't really see top-line improvement until 2026, when it outlined a 2% to 3% compound annual sales growth rate for its largest market — North America.\nI will be diving into the guide more with Whirlpool chairman and CEO Marc Bitzer in a chat that will air on Yahoo Finance Live today in the 3 p.m. ET hour.\nThe positive here: The notorious industrial cost-cutter thinks it could expand its profit margins this year, next year, and in 2026 by removing a good amount of costs.\nKeep in mind this back-end weighted outlook from Whirlpool comes on the heels of a lackluster new home sales report this week.\nThe bottom line for housing derivative stocks like Whirlpool and Home Depot (HD) to work higher again is that there will have to be new indications on when the Fed will be cutting interest rates. The expectations of rate cuts this year have been pushed back a lot amid stronger-than-expected inflation readings and various Fed speeches.\nThat said, I am a buyer of one of those new KitchenAid automatic espresso makers.

On Tuesday morning, its price had slightly dropped to $56,704.\nSince the start of the year, bitcoin has risen 28% as result of renewed interest in the digital currency after the U.S. approved the first bitcoin spot ETFs. A technical event called halving, which restrains the mining of new bitcoins, is approaching in April and has also contributed to rising demand.\nBitcoin is a little over $10,000 away from the all-time high it hit in November 2021, of over $68,000.\nRecent transactions in the cryptocurrency market have led to bitcoin gaining more than 10% in value over the past two days.\nMicroStrategy, an enterprise software and cloud service firm, revealed Monday that it has bought this month 3,000 bitcoin for $155.4 million. The company now owns a total of 193,000 coins worth about $10 billion.\nOver $6 billion have entered the market since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January. The largest one, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, rose nearly 7% on Tuesday and was up 4% during premarket trading.\nAnother contributor to the digital currency’s hot demand is its upcoming “halving” event. In April, reward miners get will be halved from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125. This happens every four years and will continue until all 21 million bitcoins are mined.\nThe market cap of all bitcoin has surpassed $1 trillion this year, bringing the market cap of all cryptocurrencies to $2 trillion.\nEthereum, a smaller cryptocurrency, is up 7% to $3,274. The stock of the cyrpto exchange Coinbase has risen 6% during premarket trading, with its share price jumping 16% yesterday. bitcoin miner Riot Platforms is up 5% this morning.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Buoyed by the successful launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), asset managers are lining up to list a second wave of more complex crypto products, setting the stage for another tussle with the U.S. securities regulator.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected spot bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade, hoping to protect investors from market manipulation. But the SEC was forced to approve them last month after Grayscale Investments won a court challenge. A federal appeals court ruled that the SEC had not sufficiently detailed its reasoning for rejecting the products. That decision encouraged 12 asset managers, including Grayscale, ProShares, VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity and Ark Investments to file applications to launch 25 next-generation cryptocurrency ETFs.\nMany are complex products that would use options to amplify bitcoin's volatility. Others would track the price of ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin. Investors hope the new products will help drive crypto further into the mainstream. Bitcoin hit $50,000 on Feb. 12 for the first time in over two years and ether has climbed more than 12% this year on hopes the SEC will approve the spot products.\nYet the SEC remains uncomfortable with cryptocurrencies and complex exchange-traded products, and lawyers and industry sources said they expect the agency to move cautiously. The legal status of ether is also ambiguous, they noted. \"It doesn't seem like there's a rush to approve a second wave of products,\" said Yesha Yadav, a professor focusing on digital asset regulation at Vanderbilt University, adding the SEC would have to \"grapple with\" how much risk it can stomach.\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler remains a crypto critic, and when approving the bitcoin ETFs, he warned they were highly risky and said the decision did not signal the SEC was willing to approve listing standards for crypto assets more broadly. An executive at one issuer said it was unclear whether SEC approval of the bitcoin ETFs would pave the way for other products.\nSome applications before the SEC are for products designed for day traders: Leveraged exchange-traded bitcoin products would seek to juice returns by further amplifying the cryptocurrency's significant volatility. Other applications are for inverse products that allow speculators to bet on a decline in the price. The SEC has approved many inverse and leveraged ETFs, but has been cautious after a volatility-tracking exchange-traded note went bust in 2018, costing investors $2 billion in losses. In 2020, it capped ETF leverage at 200%, and the agency is due to review its rules on ETF risks this year, according to its regulatory agenda.\nGensler and Democratic SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw have also warned about risks of inverse and leveraged ETFs. The SEC would only formally stop these products from launching if it found their disclosures to be materially misleading, people familiar with the matter said, but they added it could delay the effective date of a filing or suggest an issuer withdraw it if staff have concerns. James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University, said the SEC would likely avoid outright rejection of applications, which could invite a legal challenge.\n\"I think they will look for every possible detail or excuse they can to delay the process,\" he added. There is no clear process for SEC approval of options on the bitcoin ETFs, which have usually been approved days after an ETF launch, so approval could take months going forward, Reuters reported this month.\nProShares, Invesco, Fidelity and Ark Investments declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. ETHER CLASH?\nBecause the spot ether ETFs would be a new product and require a rule change, the SEC must approve or deny them by a set deadline. VanEck's filing is first in line for a decision on May 23, while the deadline for Grayscale's ether application is June 18. The SEC has yet to engage substantively with issuers on the applications, but is expected to begin meetings next month, said two other people familiar with the matter. The agency has not yet disclosed meetings on the products in its public log.\nAsked about the spot ether ETF filings this month, Gensler told CNBC the SEC's five commissioners would review them. Both Democrat commissioners voted against the bitcoin ETFs, while the two Republicans voted for them. That means Gensler would likely have the deciding vote. The arguments Grayscale used to defeat the SEC in its bitcoin ETF suit could apply to the ether products because the circumstances are similar. But some regulatory experts and issuers said Gensler could argue ether is a different type of asset.\nThe SEC has said bitcoin is a commodity, but has not made a determination on ether. Unlike bitcoin, ether is traded on a so-called \"proof-of-stake\" blockchain that allows users to earn yield in exchange for locking up tokens for a period of time. Gensler has questioned whether this setup resembles a traditional security. \"There are different circumstances the SEC will consider. The biggest circumstance is that they consider bitcoin to be a commodity and not a security,\" said Frank Borger Gilligan, a securities attorney at Dickinson Wright who said the SEC would want assurances that any new products had investor safeguards.\nAsked by CNBC last week if it will take another lawsuit to force the SEC to approve ether ETFs, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said it was \"too early to say.\"\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025",null,null]}

It marks a major resurgence for the  cryptocurrency staple. The increased interest in Bitcoin seems to be the reason for the outage.\nThis article originally appeared on Gizmodo.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Bitcoin blew past $60,000 for the first time in more than two years on Wednesday as the popularity of spot ETFs drove a renewed trading frenzy for volatile cryptocurrencies — and crashed popular crypto exchange Coinbase.\nThe price of bitcoin soared to nearly $64,000 in the early afternoon, nearing it’s all-time high of $$68,789 in November 2021, before falling to around $61,000 by 6 p.m. That marked an 18% increase in the leading digital currency compared to one week ago and 40% bump compared to a month ago.\nIn the midst of Wednesday’s rally, Coinbase, one of the largest digital asset exchanges, warned users that its website was experiencing issues – but assured customers that their “assets are safe” after several complained that their digital wallets showed “$0.00.”\n“We are dealing with a large surge of traffic — apologies for any issues you encounter,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X.\nThe bullish run on the world’s most popular crypto token could be the start of what Split Capital’s Zaheer Ebtikar called “a pretty clear FOMO kind of rally,” referring to the “fear of missing out.”\n“More and more people are just convinced to buy,” Ebkitar told Bloomberg.\nThe massive early success of recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs — which allow investors to acquire stakes in funds that own bitcoin offered by Blackrock, Fidelity and other firms – has played a key role in the surge, experts told The Post.\nThe boom drove $520 million into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, a one-day record.\n“I do think the fact this is happening concurrent with the ETFs – and you can look at the inflows of those things – that seems to be a pretty big driver for this [rally],” said Colin Harper, head of research at the bitcoin mining software firm Luxor.\n“There’s a large segment of the population that sees regulatory approval as, ‘well, the state’s okay with this, they’re not going to ban it, institutions are cleared now.’… “There’s a lot more legitimacy to it for the average person,” Harper added.\nHowever, other market experts warned that investors may soon see a “sharp correction” of 20% or more.\n“This move has been very sharp, leverage is very high at the moment,” AnB Investments’ Jaime Baeza Baeza told Bloomberg.\nThe overall market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market hovered at a whopping $2.31 trillion as of Wednesday afternoon – after crossing the $2 trillion threshold earlier this month for the first time in two years.\nCryptocurrencies have re-emerged as a hot asset alongside other trendy bets such as AI chipmaker Nvidia and weight-loss drug maker Eli Lilly, according to Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management.\n“You have the additional momentum of it being legitimatized by the SEC approving the ETFs from Blackrock and others. And then, frankly, the trash was hauled off to the curb in the form of Binance and FTX,” Dollarhide said. “You get rid of some bad actors and you rebuild trust within the crypto space.”\nThe latest rally in bitcoin’s price brought it within striking distance of its all-time high of $69,000 – a number that seemed unattainable over the last two years as a so-called “crypto winter” crushed demand for cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin’s struggles throughout 2021 and 2022 were compounded by a number of scandals, including the collapse of convicted crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire.\nWe are dealing with a LARGE surge of traffic – apologies for any issues you encounter. The team is working to remediate.\nOther bullish factors include investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut sky-high interest rates at some point this year as well as a looming bitcoin “halving”– a pre-planned event due in April that reduces the amount of digital currency people receive for “mining” by half.\nBitcoin’s “halvings” are meant to ensure the currency’s scarcity over time. While the exact impact of each halving on bitcoin’s value is up for debate among experts, the price of bitcoin has soared ahead of past halvings that occurred in 2020, 2016 and 2012.\n“As the halving approaches, supply of new coins will be cut in half while demand is buoyed by the ETFs,” said Christopher Alexander, chief analytics officer at Pioneer Development Group.\n“Once the small retail investors fully regain confidence in crypto exchanges there will be demand pressure at a level that has never been seen before,” Alexander added.\nWith Post wires\nAdvertisement","In this article\nWhen MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor came on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" in December to talk about crypto, he said, \"the one thing we can count on is bitcoin goes forward in the year 2024, and a strategy built around bitcoin is generally a pretty safe one for institutions.\"\nWhile the long-term safety of bitcoin may still be up for debate, Saylor's strategy has been a hugely lucrative one, particularly this week.\nShares of MicroStrategy, which derives the vast majority of its value from its bitcoin holdings, jumped 10% on Wednesday, bringing its three-day rally to 40%. Saylor is MicroStrategy's biggest investor, with a 12% stake in the company. He also disclosed in 2020 personal ownership of 17,732 bitcoins.\nAdd it up and Saylor is about $700 million richer than he was on Sunday.\nBetween Saylor's MicroStrategy control and his bitcoin, his holdings climbed to $2.96 billion in value on Wednesday from $2.27 billion at the start of the week.\nA MicroStrategy spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on Saylor's personal finances.\nThe big catalyst this week has been bitcoin's rally to its highest level since November 2021. The digital currency rose as high as about $64,000 on Wednesday, up from $51,500 early Monday. It pulled back to around $60,000 later in the day after Coinbase's app suffered glitches that led many users to see a balance of zero in their accounts.\nSaylor, who founded MicroStrategy in 1989 and remains the company's chairman, is one of bitcoin's principal evangelists, co-authoring a book about the cryptocurrency in 2023 titled \"What is Money?\"\nMicroStategy has a business in enterprise software and cloud-based services, but its bitcoin ownership effectively makes the company a proxy for the world's biggest cryptocurrency.\nThe company said on Monday that it acquired an additional 3,000 bitcoins for a total of $155 million between Feb. 15 and Feb. 25. MicroStrategy, along with its subsidiaries, now owns about 193,000 bitcoins worth close to $12 billion.\nMicroStrategy announced its plan to invest in bitcoin in mid-2020, disclosing in an earnings call that it would commit $250 million over the next 12 months to \"one or more alternative assets,\" which could include digital currencies like bitcoin. At the time, the company's market cap was about $1.1 billion. It's now worth more than $16 billion.\nDuring MicroStrategy's latest earnings call on Feb. 7, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the company is \"the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, and we have remained committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the highest conviction.\"\nMicroStrategy shares are now up 52% for the year after soaring 346% in 2023.\nWATCH: MicroStrategy's CEO talks Bitcoin's price passing $50,000","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nUS stocks retreated on Wednesday as caution prevailed ahead of a crucial inflation report that will guide expectations for interest rate cuts.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell less than 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) about 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sagged almost 0.6%.\nStocks have struggled in February's final days as fresh economic data helped bring a market boosted by AI euphoria back to the reality of higher-for-longer interest rates. Investors have spent this week counting down to the PCE inflation reading on Thursday, seen as key in determining how quickly the Federal Reserve will start making rate cuts.\nIn the meantime, a report on fourth quarter GDP showed the economy grew at a slightly slower pace than initally thought in the final three months of 2023. The second estimate of fourth quarter GDP came in at 3.2% on Tuesday, down from the initial reading of 3.3%.\nIn other asset markets, bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its roaring rally, breaking above $63,000 on Wednesday to come within striking distance of a fresh all-time high. The arrival of spot bitcoin ETFs has helped the cryptocurrency reach levels not seen since late 2021.\nAmong big movers, shares of Beyond Meat (BYND) soared more than 30% after the plant-based meat company laid out its turnaround plan, triggering a short squeeze.\nParamount Global (PARA) reported fourth quarter results on Wednesday that came in mixed as the company revealed full-year streaming losses peaked in 2022 while linear TV revenue continued to plummet.\nParamount, like other media companies, has struggled amid a tough ad environment. Big Tech companies have seen their businesses rebound while smaller players have not.\nLinear ad revenue slumped 15% year over year in the quarter, steeper than the 12% drop expected by analysts and also worse than the 14% year-over-year slump seen in the third quarter.\nThe company said the drop reflects continued softness in the global advertising market and a 5-percentage-point impact from lower political advertising. Advertising revenue in the quarter was also impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\nIn one bright spot, Paramount reported a Q4 direct-to-consumer (DTC) loss of $490 million, narrower than analyst expectations of $534 million and the $575 million loss seen in the year-earlier period. The company reported a $238 million loss in the third quarter.\n\"We now expect to reach domestic Paramount+ profitability in 2025,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said in the earnings release.\nStocks were lower on Wednesday ahead of a highly anticipated inflation update due out before the opening bell on Thursday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell less than 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) about 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sagged almost 0.6%.\nIt was not, however, a quiet day for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $63,000 per coin for the first time since 2021, sending crypto-related stocks rallying. MicroStrategy (MSTR) popped about 10% amid the rally and is now up almost 100% in the last month.\nTomorrow is Feb. 29, a day that only comes once every four years.\nWhile there isn't a true financial significance to Leap Day, we took a look back to see how the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has performed on the rare trading day. Our analysis shows it has been a positive day for the S&P 500 65% of the time.\nOne of Wall Street's favorite calls to start this year was to buy small caps as many projected a broadening in the market rally.\nThis trade largely flopped in January, as a few large tech stocks continued to drive the major indexes higher while small caps lagged.\nBut in the last month, the themes that have dominated the broader market — artificial intelligence, weight-loss drugs and cryptocurrency— have helped small caps catch up to the other major indexes.\nWe've been flagging major moves in stocks like Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), and Microstrategy (MSTR) as investors search for other ways to play these themes. All three of those stocks are up significantly in the last month, headlined by Viking Therapeutics' more than 350% move.\nAll three of those stocks are also top 10 contributors to the total value of the BlackRock iShares Russell 2000 index (IWM), which closely mirrors the Russell 2000. This could help explain how small caps have participated in the recent momentum trade in markets.\nBitcoin led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday as the largest digital asset hit its highest level since 2021, at one point surpassing $63,000. Ethereum moved higher by less than 2% to just less than $3,300 per coin.\nBeyond Meat (BYND) soared more than 40% after the company reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter and announced plans to cut operating costs. The company's stock had also been massively shorted headed into the print.\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) stock fell about 4% on Wednesday following a Wall Street Journal report that the US Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into the company.\nThe solar industry has struggled this past year amid a pileup of panels and higher interest rates. Yet one outlier has been First Solar (FSLR), the largest US solar module manufacturer.\nShares of the Tempe, Ariz.-based company ticked higher on Wednesday after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings and upbeat guidance.\n\"Despite industry macro challenges, such as global oversupply and pricing volatility, we continue to see strong mid- to long-term demand, especially in the United States,\" First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said during the company's earnings call.\nFirst Solar has been a major beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows domestic solar manufacturers to sell tax credits to other firms. Last year the company agreed to sell $687 million in tax credits to fintech company Fiserv (FI).\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock, with 25 Buy and seven Hold recommendations.\nStill, First Solar shares have been dragged down 12% year to date amid an overall slump in solar-related stocks.\nRead more here.\nAmid a rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) that saw the world's largest digital currency reach over $63,000 per coin, a popular crypto exchange had a malfunction.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, some users on Coinbase (COIN), which offers crypto trading, weren't able to see how much money was in their account or make transactions.\n\"We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling.

Gross merchandise volume didn’t even grow in the final quarter of last year.\nBut when all is said and done, stock prices do things for a variety of reasons. And eBay apparently did enough to get some folks on the Street chattering about the stock as a sort of value play in an overheated tech market.\nThe company increased its stock buyback authorization by $2 billion. Non-GAAP operating margins of 26.7% also came in at the high end of the company’s guidance amid a focus on cost cutting.\nSexy company? Nope. Sexy stock? Not exactly by most measures. But an intriguing earnings day that will likely get value investors kicking the tires on eBay in the near term.\nUS stocks were lower on Wednesday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sagged almost 0.4%.\nBut that didn't halt a rally in crypto-related stocks as bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly reached above $63,000.

The company also unveiled a host of new AI tools last year, setting the stage for a further profit unlock in 2024.\nBut to my point above, Salesforce shares are \"only\" up 7% in the past month compared to a 16% pop for Snowflake.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss had a dose of smart insight into sentiment on Salesforce right now:\n\"With Salesforce performing just inline with large cap software intra-quarter, maintaining its valuation discount to the peer-set despite an easier bookings comparison, stable-to-improving [demand] checks, and price increases rolling through the model, we view Salesforce's upcoming FQ4 earnings as a likely positive catalyst for shares. While we acknowledge Salesforce has become increasingly embraced as an overweight name amongst the investing community since our upgrade in December, we still find a healthy amount of debate around the potential for (and timing of) a sustainable re-acceleration in revenue growth in our investor conversations, leading us to believe potential upside to FQ4 & FY25 (CY24) estimates is not yet in the price ahead of earnings.\"\nCatch up on what Salesforce has been up to ahead of earnings — I just chatted with co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff at the World Economic Forum a few weeks ago.\nThe second estimate for fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) showed the US economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the final three months of 2023, down from the initial 3.3% reading.\nGoldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius noted that the GDP was \"revised down slightly\" but under the surface actually showed promising signs.\n\"Consumption, capex, and residential investment were all revised higher,\" Goldman's team wrote. \"The downward revision [in GDP] mainly reflected lower inventory investment, which other things equal implies faster GDP growth in Q1.\"\nOxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet agreed. He described the \"small\" downward revision as \"not troubling.\"\n\"Mixed details do not warrant an immediate change to the baseline forecast for the economy to keep growing above its potential,\" Sweet wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nPerhaps the top story for markets on Wednesday isn't a stock. Once again, cryptocurrency has taken center stage as the world's largest digital coin is now selling for more than $61,000 per coin for the first time since 2021.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\nThe price of the digital asset is now up almost 19% on the week and 43% so far this year, due largely to excitement sparked by a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January.\nBitcoin was up more than 6% above $60,500 at last check, touching its highest point since November 2021. The current rally is testing whether the price can be pushed closer to its all-time high of $68,789. That apex came six months before a spectacular crash in 2022.\n\"Ultimately, what we're seeing is crypto is kind of rising from the ashes of the 2022 market,\" said Ryan Rasmussen, a senior crypto research analyst for Bitwise Asset Management.\n\"Our assumption is that the price of bitcoin is going to achieve $125,000 by the end of 2025,\" Benchmark's Mark Palmer added on Yahoo Finance Live.\nInvestors are bidding other cryptocurrencies and related stocks higher too. Year to date, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), has outperformed bitcoin by more than 4% while the total market value for all crypto assets is up roughly 36% to $2.24 trillion, according to Coinmarketcap.\nUS stocks retreated on Wednesday, coming off a mixed close as caution prevailed ahead of a crucial inflation report that will guide expectations for interest rate cuts.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were down more than 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sagged 0.3%.\nStocks have struggled in February's final days as fresh economic data helped bring a market boosted by AI euphoria back to the reality of higher-for-longer interest rates. Investors have spent this week counting down to the PCE inflation reading on Thursday, seen as key in determining how quickly the Federal Reserve will start making rate cuts.\nIn my mind, when you are a legacy retailer like Macy's (M) that communicates to investors the closure of 150 stores by 2026, it's not a one-day story.\nRather this is a story that will unfold every single day inside the company and in the impacted communities until the process is done. It will be discussed at every single investment conference a Macy's executive speaks at between now and 2026. It will be discussed on the next umpteen earnings calls for the company.\nSo if you own stock in Macy's, this is something that warrants deeper digging and staying on top of the situation (reading local news publications is helpful on this front). It's a major moment for the company that could have implications on whether it's in business 20 years from today.\nA few further thoughts after digging of my own last night:\nThe size of Macy's: After Macy's closes these 150 stores, the company will have about 350 locations open in the US. That barely quantifies as a national retailer, let alone one that could compete effectively with Amazon (AMZN). The company is ceding a ton of market share to rivals such as discounter Target (TGT), which has almost 2,000 stores in the US. Kohl's (KSS) has 1,100 stores in 49 states.\nCiti's Paul Lejuez put context around the competitive dynamic in a new note this morning: \"With Macy's putting over $2 billion in sales up for grabs over the next three years from its store closing plan, we believe this is most likely to benefit the off-price group (TJX Companies (TJX) in particular) that tends to pick up market share (sales) when department stores close stores.\"\nThe losers: What happens when 150 Macy's stores vanish? The retailers that sell products at these stores lose a key outlet to offer merchandise. Lejuez highlighted a few potential losers, all of which are publicly traded: \"Those brands that sell into Macy's (SHOO, PVH, RL, CRI, LEVI, COLM, VFC, CPRI) are likely to feel some sales pressure as a result of Macy's store-closing decision. Typically, sales put up for grabs by a department store do not end up getting picked up by other department stores.\"\nYahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma caught up with Macy's new CEO Tony Spring to discuss the store closures, among other topics. More on that here.\nTo the beyond!\nWe are witnessing a wild 55% move higher in Beyond Meat (BYND) shares this morning (was up 100% initially last night) after earnings last night. The company's ticker page is the hottest on Yahoo Finance as of this writing.\nThe plant-based meat company is shaking up its operations (bye-bye jerky products), which may have gotten a few excited about a potential turn for this long-struggling business.\nAnytime you see an outsized move like this in a stock, it’s good practice to ask: Is there something else going on here?\nIn the case of Beyond Meat, as you can see on its Yahoo Finance statistics page, it has a massive, massive short position. So, any small dose of perceived good news could be met with the type of fierce short-covering rally we have today.\nUsing the premarket price, the stock is still down 95% from its 2019 record high.\nBefore you go, I just talked to Beyond Meat's founder and CEO, Ethan Brown, late last week — catch up on the company's newest initiatives here.","Image source: Getty Images\nThe price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) continued to climb even higher this week, surging past US$60,000 as investors got back into crypto. This has caused other companies, Canadian ones included, to see some renewed interest once more.\nOne such company is Hut 8 Mining (TSX:HUT), which has seen shares climb 13% in the last year. However, shares are still down 58% since 52-week highs. It’s now seeing incredibly active trading, with its one-day volume at about 761,000 active trades right now.\nSo why are investors so interested in Hut stock? Let’s get into it.\nHut stock boasts being one of the first North American bitcoin mining companies, and one of the first publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in the world. The business mainly focuses on Bitcoin mining, but also offers data centre services. These include hosting, repair, and managed services for other miners.\nIts operations hold a diverse portfolio of facilities across Canada, using clean energy sources such as hydro and nuclear power plants to power their facilities. Further, they’re focused on cool climates to aid in efficient mining.\nAnd the company continues to expand further. Most recently, the stock made two strong announcements. This included the completion of acquiring four power generation facilities. It also included construction on a new digital asset mining site in Texas.\nThe thing is, the company is incredibly dependent on Bitcoin and its price. And that hasn’t been great over the last while. Hut stock has missed earnings estimates for the last two quarters as of writing. While earnings are due out next month, the company recently reported its third quarter back in November.\nDuring that quarter, Hut stock reported a loss of $1.20 earnings per share. This missed out on analyst estimates of a loss of $0.32 per share. What’s more, while the company didn’t release revenue figures, it did state that it mined 631 Bitcoins in the quarter. Easy math shows that would be worth US$37,860,000 as of writing!\nEven so, the mined cryptocurrency came on the market while Bitcoin was down, and mining output was lower as well. Plus, Hut stock incurred an impairment charge after a power purchase agreement. Further, there was a loss on the revaluation of digital assets. This all hurt the bottom line, even though top-line growth should occur from more mining operations and those new revenue streams such as data centres.\nIn my view, Hut 8 stock is far too risky of an investment to get into at this point. While the company’s at the beginning stages of finding new revenue streams, it’s not there yet. Meanwhile, the focus on Bitcoin means it’s far too dependent on the price. A price that, as we’ve seen, can crash at any time.\nPlus, the company has a lack of consistent profitability, and trades in an incredibly competitive landscape. And with regulatory uncertainty, who knows about the future of this stock.\nWhat it will come down to is the price of Bitcoin. That will be the be all and end all for this stock. And in that case, the future outlook looks far too risky. Until Hut 8 stock can all but guarantee that Bitcoin will continue doing well, or creates more diversification, I would stay away from it for now.\nApril 17, 2025 |\n        Amy Legate-Wolfe\nThis Canadian stock may not be the first you think of when hearing \"AI stock,\" but it should be.\nRead more »\nApril 16, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nShopify and Magellan are two top TSX stocks you can buy right now and generate outsized gains in the upcoming…\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Joey Frenette\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands out as a top Mag Seven stock for Canadian investors to buy amid tariff fears.\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nBlackBerry is a TSX tech stock that is positioned to underperform the broader markets in the near term.

And with Wednesday’s gains, it’s nearing its all-time high of around $69,000 set in November 2021, the last time bitcoin traded above $60,000.\nThe rally is partly driven by billions of dollars flowing into the cryptocurrency after the US Securities and Exchange Commission green lit bitcoin exchange-traded funds last month.\nThe other major factor at play is the upcoming “halving” of bitcoin. Halving refers to the built-in feature of bitcoin that automatically reduces the rate of new coins entering circulation. It takes place roughly every four years and, in theory, pushes the price of bitcoin higher because it creates more scarcity of an already finite currency.\nThis happens because the bitcoin miners (who are behind programs used to solve complex math problems that are intrinsic to using the token) see their bitcoin-denominated reward cut in half when a threshold is reached.\nIn the past, bitcoin halvings have catalyzed significant bullish periods. But there’s no hard rule this is the outcome each time. Any number of events — such as the prospect of new regulations — could take a bite from any potential gains that come from a halving.\nHowever, investors so far seem to be quite optimistic that won’t play out, and are rushing to get in on the action or cash out their gains. Coinbase, a crypto exchange platform, experienced major outages as a result of the surge in trading, the company’s CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on X Wednesday.\n“Some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts & may experience errors in buying or selling,” Coinbase Support posted on X around 1 pm ET on Wednesday. “Our team is investigating this & will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.”\nAn hour and a half later, Coinbase said in another post on X it was “beginning to see improvement in customer trading.” It added customers may still be experiencing some issues “due to increased traffic.”\nCoinbase declined to comment to CNN about the outages, beyond the X posts.",null,"In this article\nRetail traders appear to be using a new tool during this huge rally for bitcoin — exchange-traded funds.\nThe funds, which launched last month, have seen their trading volume surge this week as bitcoin continues to climb.\nFor example, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw about 96 million shares change hands on Wednesday, according to FactSet. That is more than double its previous record high of about 43 million shares, which came on Tuesday.\nAnother multibillion dollar fund, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), saw roughly 27 million shares change hands on Wednesday, easily surpassing the 16.8 million traded on Jan. 11, its first day of trading.\nMeanwhile, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) was traded about 7 million times, or about 1 million higher than its Jan. 11 record.\nThe highly active market around these funds is likely a sign that retail traders are using the ETFs to participate in the bitcoin rally. The largest cryptocurrency crossed the $60,000 mark on Wednesday for the first time since November 2021.\nWhile ETFs are used by all types of investors, the heavy intraday trading suggests that retail traders are a sizable group buying and selling the funds.\nThe trading volume is even more impressive when considering the price. Bitcoin has risen about 30% since the ETFs were approved, and the tracking funds have all increased in price over the past six weeks, including a big jump this week.\nThat price movement means that many of the funds saw a record dollar amount traded on Wednesday, as well.\nOne notable exception to the trend was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), whose trading volume was still far off of its levels from January. The fund, which has seen billions of dollars of outflows since its launch, had about 34 million shares traded on Wednesday, well below its Jan. 11 number. Still, that translates to more than $1.5 billion in trading volume.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","Indian stock market: The domestic equity indices are expected to open on a cautious note on Thursday amid weakness in global peers as investors watch out for key economic data releases.\nAsian markets traded lower while the US stock indices closed in the red overnight ahead of the key US inflation data.

Let’s get into it.\nThis week the crypto market was very hyped up as the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, both jumped about 23.6% and 18%, respectively, on the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market cap increased 19.4% over a seven-day period to $2.34 trillion.\nThe recent price jump for bitcoin, coupled with the incoming bitcoin halving and spot bitcoin ETF approvals in early January boosting demand, has many crypto market players wondering if the grandfather of cryptocurrencies will hit a new all-time high soon or if this rally is short-lived.\nICYMI, last week a lot of crypto people were tweeting about emails from Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi said a lot of interesting things, but this post on X by Tom Schmidt, partner at Dragonfly Capital, got a lot of attention and even caused some Bitcoiners to go out and buy a pineapple and jalapeno pizza in honor of it. Which brings me to the question…would you eat that?\nChain Reaction is doing a monthly series diving into different topics and themes in crypto.

Outside of that, he consults with agencies and brands about building their web3 strategies, including his role with Starbucks, where he is a community lead for its NFT-focused loyalty program, Starbucks Odyssey.\nBefore getting into the web3 world, Steve worked in communications and marketing roles for more than 15 years.\nJacquelyn and Steve discussed what got him interested in NFTs, how important it is to build understanding for the sector and why communities matter more than floor prices.\nThey also dove into:\nBONUS: For this week’s episode, we’re resharing a conversation I had in June 2023 with Jack Lu, CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden.\nWhen we recorded this episode, NFT sales were down around $640 million at the beginning of the month, compared to today where February 2024 NFT sales volume hit $1 billion, for the first time since February 2023.\nLooking back on this conversation, we decided this episode was a great addition to the NFT series to add some context for what a crazy year it has been and how much things have changed (and some things stayed the same) — especially for people building in the NFT space.\nMagic Eden originally began as a Solana-based NFT trading platform, but has expanded its support to other blockchain networks like Polygon, Ethereum and Bitcoin.

As of Thursday morning, its price was around $62,460.\nBut an upcoming event known as halving could push that price growth further.\nHalving happens automatically when 210,000 \"blocks\" are created as part of the bitcoin mining process. This happens approximately every four years, and it discourages coin production by reducing the reward for mining new bitcoin by half. The last halving event was in 2020, and the next one is expected sometime in April.\nHalving is meant to slow the supply of coins as it approaches its total supply, which is capped at 21 million coins. The built-in mechanism mimics the scarcity of gold and ensures that bitcoin mining becomes more expensive over time.\n\"The expectation is that the halving will lead to an increase in price because people expect supply to become constrained,\" says Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.\n\"When supply goes down, price goes up, assuming demand remains the same or greater,\" says Boneparth, who holds investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nHistorically, the value of bitcoin has increased shortly after its three previous halving events, albeit with diminishing returns with each halving, according to CoinDesk.\nOf course, the implications of bitcoin's halving could be baked into its current price, since the imminent halving is widely known.\n\"It could be priced in, but now that the spot ETFs are here, the thinking is that institutions will need to buy more bitcoin on the open market to back the flows into their funds,\" says Boneparth.\nAs with all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is a highly speculative asset that's extremely volatile, sometimes with price fluctuations of 5% to 10% in a single day.\nWhile money can be made on bitcoin's price swings, past performance doesn't guarantee future success. There are no guarantees that it will retain any of its current value, either.\nAnd unlike traditional investments such as stocks or bonds, bitcoin doesn't represent ownership in a physical asset or a claim on future earnings.\nFinancial planners commonly recommend traditional investments like S&P 500 index funds, which offer less risk. Plus, the S&P 500's average annual return is more than 10%.\nThat said, some experts may recommend a small stake in bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio of investments. But even so, it's still considered a high-risk asset.\n\"I think it makes sense for most folks to hold a small holding of cryptocurrencies, maybe 1% or 2% of an entire portfolio,\" Chris Diodato, a CFP and founder of WELLth Financial Planning, previously told CNBC Make It.\n\"I'm hesitant to recommend more because, in addition to its significant volatility, it doesn't produce cash flow like traditional investments — it's only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it.\"\nWant to land your dream job in 2024? Take CNBC's new online course How to Ace Your Job Interview to learn what hiring managers are really looking for, body language techniques, what to say and not to say, and the best way to talk about pay.

On Wednesday, it surged to $64,000 at one point, before a wave of long liquidations triggered a pullback to about $60,000.\nAs bitcoin took a breath after its big run on Thursday — it's on pace for a 21% weekly gain — other cryptocurrencies caught up. Ether surged 3.5% to $3,400.80. Tokens tied to Ethereum rivals Solana and Cardano jumped 16% and 9%, respectively.\nThe two blue-chip coins shot higher in February after finishing January little changed. Bitcoin ended up nearly 45% for the month, marking its sixth-straight monthly gain — its best showing since December 2020. Ether advanced more than 47%, also a sixth straight monthly advance and its best month since July 2022.\nFebruary was a triumph for bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which saw a record $677 million in daily net inflows on Wednesday alone, the third straight day of inflows above $500 million. Initially, outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), which had a head start on rivals from its days as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, had weighed on the bitcoin price. Those outflows have since diminished.\nInvestors attribute February's explosive gains to bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics. Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs, pointed to the new ETFs and the upcoming bitcoin halving as catalysts.\n\"We've seen over $2 billion coming into the various bitcoin ETFs so there's been this need to access more supply of bitcoin to build these ETFs and that ends up driving prices up, particularly in the near term,\" she said.\n\"The second reason why you might be getting some extra momentum in the price over the last couple of days is the upcoming halving,\" she added. \"Historically, the halving has led to bitcoin prices increasing … past performance is not indicative of future performance, but I do think there's this belief that the halving process will result in the same level of price appreciation.\"\nThe halving is a mandate in the bitcoin code to cut the reward of mining bitcoin in half to reduce the supply of bitcoin every few years and create a scarcity effect. The next one is expected this April.\nFebruary is a historically strong month for both bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin has now finished 10 of the last 12 Februarys in the green and has had an average return of 15.7% for the month, according to CoinGlass. Ether has ended the month higher in seven of the last eight Februarys since its inception, giving it an average February gain of 17.2%.\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","BREAKING: Dow Jones Cuts 600-Point Drop, Oil Stocks Up\nInvestors.com will undergo scheduled maintenance from 10:00 PM ET to 2:00 AM ET and some features may be unavailable.

Aptos, the a16z- and Tiger Global-backed blockchain network developed by a group of former Meta employees, is one of them.\nStarted by some of the original creators of Meta’s abandoned crypto payment project Diem, Aptos is set to host a DeFi event in Hong Kong this April. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, which tries to replace traditional banking intermediaries with decentralized technology, has been a prominent use case in the blockchain space so far.\n“I was in Hong Kong twice last year in a span of three months,” said Mo Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of Aptos, which is a layer 1 blockchain, meaning it doesn’t rely on existing decentralized networks like Ethereum or Solana.\n“And what I noticed was there is an incredible amount of resurgence when it comes to the appetite to build, to disrupt, and a massive focus on web3, whether it was meeting folks like Alibaba or Tencent, to even meeting with other financial institutions like HSBC and incubators out there. So when we see that level of activity, that level of interest in Aptos, we obviously have to make sure we can’t ignore it,” he added.\nIndeed, an X\/Twitter Space Aptos hosted in Mandarin Chinese this week attracted over 45,000 listeners.\nWhile mainland China bans all forms of cryptocurrency trading, the government leaves the option open in Hong Kong, a move seen by many industry watchers as a sandbox for Beijing to toy with web3 without potentially incurring financial volatility for the rest of the country.\nAptos already works with Alibaba to reach web3 developers in Asia. In November, the two partners announced they planned to co-host hackathons that used Move, the open source programming language developed by Meta.\nOn the Aptos chain, Move is used to write smart contracts, which are lines of code that automatically execute predetermined terms of agreements. Solidity is the primary language used to program smart contracts on Ethereum, the largest blockchain by developer activity.\nAptos has its eye on all emerging markets. One of its most ambitious endeavors is the JamboPhone, a joint effort between the blockchain and Jambo, a Congo-based startup aiming to be the “web3 super app” of Africa. Priced at $99, the phone comes preinstalled with the Aptos-compatible wallet Petra and is selling in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\nLayer 1 blockchain Solana’s Saga phone is clearly targeting a different demographic with its $1,000 price tag.\n“The cool thing about [JamboPhone] is, imagine you had new forms of digital money, a stablecoin, the eHKD or even the Singaporean dollar, that money can now be available instantly on these devices, and expand into creating real value for people that often are left out of the financial system,” Shaikh suggested.\nWhen asked when users in Hong Kong will get access to Aptos-based DeFi services, the founder said he cannot speculate on regulation.\n“I do think Hong Kong regulators are moving things in the right direction and forward and providing clarity for entrepreneurs to build. And I think that is a very healthy sign for us to continue to lean into,” he added.\nHong Kong is charting its own web3 path despite China’s anti-crypto stance\nTopics\nReporter, China\nThe latest viral ChatGPT trend is doing ‘reverse location search’ from photos\nChapter, a Medicare startup with links to Vance, Thiel, and Ramaswamy, just raised a round at $1.5B valuation\nOpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3B, with news expected later this week\nRivian’s first non-Amazon van customer is HelloFresh\nMicrosoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\nFor security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\nNotorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked","Elaine Kurtenbach\nAssociated Press\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In between is the main course: the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred measure of consumer prices, the PCE deflator.\nRates bets were on the move on Thursday, but not for Europe or the U.S., where over the first two months of this year, traders have already aggressively paired back expectations on how soon interest rate cuts will come.\nInstead, Bank of Japan board member Hajime Takata turbo-charged the yen with a speech expounding the need to overhaul ultra-easy stimulus settings, sending the currency soaring some 0.7% to push through the closely watched 150 level for the first time in more than a week.\nMost other markets were content to sit tight ahead of the key data, with a modicum of calm even returning to bitcoin after its three-day, 24% rocket ride to a more than two-year peak at $63,933.\nJapanese and Chinese equities went opposite directions, with the Nikkei continuing to cool following its surge to an all-time high, while the CSI 300 bounced back from the prior day's losses to again sit close to three-month highs ahead of the annual session of the National People's Congress next week, when growth targets will be set and a stimulus path charted.\nIn another Asian development that might interest global investors in Thailand's tourist industry, the country plans to this year roll back trailblazing legislation from 2022 that made recreational marijuana legal.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n-German states, France, Spain CPI (Feb)\n-France, Switzerland, Sweden GDP\n-U.S. PCE deflator (Jan)\n(Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"]}
