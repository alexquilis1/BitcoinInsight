In 2023, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S.\nAlso in 2023, Binance's Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.\nNow that those two high-profile cases are out the way, many cryptocurrency executives see it as a chance to move forward and draw a line under the bad behavior of two of the industry's poster children.\nWith fervor returning to the crypto markets, industry executives are calling the start of a new bull run, mainly predicated on two things — the bitcoin \"halving\" and the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\nThe halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin.\nMeanwhile, there is growing excitement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF, after years of opposition. This would mean investors can buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin, without having to go on to an exchange and hold the digital currency directly. The industry is hoping this will draw in a wider range of investors, and in particular, large institutional investors.\nWith all of this excitement comes some quite bold predictions about bitcoin's price. Here's a selection of some of them.\nIn 2022, Mark Mobius correctly forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000. He had a price call of $10,000 thereafter, which he stuck to in 2023. However, that did not materialize, as bitcoin rallied.\nFor 2024, Mobius told CNBC that bitcoin could reach $60,000 by the end of the year.\n\"No rationale for that prediction,\" Mobius said, except that a bitcoin ETF looks likely and \"that has heightened interest\" in the cryptocurrency.\nYouwei Yang, chief economist of crypto mining firm Bit Mining, believes that bitcoin could reach a high of $75,000 by 2024.\nYang attributes the anticipated price rise to a bitcoin ETF being approved, leading to higher institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as May 2024's bitcoin halving, which would result in the bitcoin supply being constrained.\n\"I anticipate the Bitcoin will be trading around $25K to $75K in 2024, and $45K to $130K in 2025,\" Yang said in an emailed note.\n\"While high prices are possible, not all investors will profit due to market volatility and the human tendencies of fear and greed.\"\nYang said the ETF approval remains the biggest story for bitcoin in 2024 — though investors should hold a degree of caution on timing given the wounds left by collapses of major crypto firms like Luna and FTX, and as it is an election year when the topic of crypto is likely to become more of a political issue.\n\"Timing the market is hard, but a gradual approach — accumulating in bear markets and taking profits in bull markets — might be a more effective strategy for whom don't have early-on accumulations.\"\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the landscape for digital assets is set for \"significant change\" in 2024, driven by the potential approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\n\"This long-awaited development is poised to expand the investor base for cryptocurrencies and integrate them more closely with traditional financial markets,\" Butterfill told CNBC via email.\n\"Estimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000.\"\nMeanwhile, the scenario of central banks cutting interest rates could also \"play a decisive role\" in moving bitcoin higher, Butterfill added.\nThe market will be also looking at factors beyond the halving — which he considers already priced into bitcoin — that could influence the price of the digital coin further.\n\"Thus, while the halving is a known event, other elements, particularly the potential for interest rate reductions, are likely to be significant in shaping Bitcoin's price in the future,\" Butterfill said.\nAntoni Trenchev, a noted bitcoin bull and co-founder of Nexo, a cryptocurrency exchange, believes bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024.\nIn 2022, he called for bitcoin to hit $100,000, but that didn't happen. Instead, the price of bitcoin collapsed that year. He held off from any further price predictions.\nBut in a note in December, Trenchev reinstated his $100,000 call for 2024, citing the halving and potential approval of multiple bitcoin ETFs.\n\"My expectation for 2024 is that the twin-turbo boost from the Bitcoin halving & spot ETF approval should propel Bitcoin to $100,000, with the prospect of further highs in 2025,\" Trenchev said in a note. \"The road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin.\"\nTrenchev added that the biggest gains will come from digital tokens and projects \"that aren't even on the radar yet.\"\nIn November, Standard Chartered doubled down on its $100,000 call for bitcoin made in April. The bank said this will be driven by the approval of numerous ETFs.\nThe halving will also be supportive for bitcoin, the bank said.\nIn 2022, University of Sussex professor of finance Carol Alexander had a fairly successful run of calling bitcoin's future price.\nShe predicted bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. That year, bitcoin fell as low as around $15,480, according to CoinDesk data. For 2023, Alexander said bitcoin would rally as high as $50,000. Bitcoin reached a yearly high of roughly $44,700 in early December.\nAlexander told CNBC that during the first quarter of 2024, bitcoin will trade within the $40,000 to $55,000 range, owing to \"professional traders creating volatility.\"\nThe next stage will depend on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settles charges against Coinbase and Binance, which could be required before approval of a bitcoin ETF, according to Alexander, echoing other commentators. The SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance in 2023.\nAlexander said settlement of those charges is likely in either the second or third quarter, after which ETFs will be approved and bitcoin's price will rise to $70,000, a new all-time high.\nThe price after that depends on the abilities of the ETF providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, \"to equip their market makers not only to create the ETFs, but also to defend price manipulations\" on exchanges which create \"excessive volatility.\"\n\"Before end of 2024 price could exceed $100k, but only if Blackrock and Fidelity market maker algorithms have the ability to reduce volatility,\" Alexander concluded.\nMatrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note in November projecting that bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year.\n\"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report.\n\"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\"\nMany commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin, which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife, though many disagree with this theory.\nVenture capital CoinFund has one of the highest price calls for bitcoin for 2024.\n\"Bitcoin has a strong inverse correlation with the dollar and real yields, and both are now going down,\" Seth Ginns, managing partner at CoinFund, told CNBC via email. \"We also expect the follow through inflows post-launch of the BTC spot ETF, as well as growing excitement around the likely approval of ETH (ether) spot ETFs later in 2024, will be quite meaningful.\"\nGinns added that he thinks the industry is in the process of \"regulatory normalization.\"\nGinns said that bitcoin could touch $1 million per coin \"in this next cycle,\" but said a more \"reasonable expectation\" for 2024 would see bitcoin between $250,000 and $500,000."]}

The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index—a broader representation of crypto as an investment asset class—gave a return of around 140% during the year, telling us that crypto as an asset class did very well in 2023.\nNow, when it comes to retail investors investing in a particular asset class, there is always a bit of a recency effect involved, as investors tend to favour assets which have done well in the short-term. So, there is some fervour for an asset class once it has done well. But that fervour seems to have been missing for Bitcoin in particular and crypto in general during 2023.\nThe volume of Bitcoin—or the total number of times it has been traded in a given period—seems to clearly suggest so. The volume for a period of seven days ending 25 December was around a tenth of the volume for the period of seven days ending 22 February 2021, when the highest weekly Bitcoin volume was achieved.\nFurther, in 2023, the total volume of Bitcoin traded was around 39% of the volume traded in 2021 and 61% of the volume traded in 2022. So, clearly there is significantly less interest despite the massive rise in its price.\nWhy is this the case? First, in the Indian case, a 30% tax on capital gains made in buying and selling crypto has been introduced. Further, if investors face a loss while buying and selling crypto, they are not allowed to offset these losses against other crypto gains or any other gains. This has lowered the popularity of cryptos in India.\nSecond, as Ben McKenzie writes with Jacob Silverman in Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud: “Most people who had ever purchased crypto entered the market in 2020 and 2021, and most of those people had lost money.\" Bitcoin and crypto prices peaked in early November 2021. Clearly, it is a case of once bitten twice shy for many.\nThird, typically when retail investors invest in an asset class once it has rallied substantially, the fear of missing out (FOMO) dynamic is at work. In the Indian case, the FOMO trade has moved to small-cap stocks and financial derivatives this time round. These are as easy to buy as was the case with crypto two years back. Also, financial influencers who were busy talking up crypto the last time it rallied have now moved on to small-cap stocks and derivatives. That has impacted word of mouth.\nFourth, since the beginning of 2022, many crypto scams have come to the fore. Investors have perhaps also come to realize that most crypto is owned by a few owners or ‘whales’ as they are more popularly known. These whales had been carrying out circular trading among themselves in order to bid up crypto prices. Once they had done that, they would dump crypto and make a killing at the cost of retail investors. As McKenzie and Silverman write: “A working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research from December 2022 found that 70 percent of trades on unregulated exchanges were fake. For Binance, the biggest exchange in crypto by a country mile in terms of trading volume, that number was 46 percent.\" There were also multiple cases of crypto exchanges operating out of shady tax havens shutting down and investors losing access to their money. Clearly, the crypto industry was more in the mood of taking retail investor money and running away with it than running a proper business. Nonetheless, as the old cliché goes, you can’t fool all the people all the time.\nFifth, despite all the talk around the use cases of crypto, nothing substantial came out of it, and it turned out to be “an asset whose value derives solely from greater fools\" pricing it “as high as the last idiot willing to buy it.\" Of course, some greater fools continue to be around.\nSixth, when crypto prices rallied through 2021, the industry and its people were all over the media, through advertisements as well as expert comments. Those running crypto exchanges were repeatedly asked how they saw the future of crypto, and they, not surprisingly, kept talking it up. But now crypto advertisements and experts seem to have disappeared. So, there is no real communication happening from the industry to egg on another round of greater fools, possibly because venture capitalist money that funded the industry might be running out or the industry might be playing it safe, given the government crackdown on its unregulated nature, including in China and India.\nSeventh, through most of 2020 and 2021, interest rates all across the world were at fairly low levels, encouraging retail investors to take on greater risk in order to be able to earn a higher return. But that has since changed. Interest rates through 2023 were significantly higher, allowing investors a safer investing option in the form of bank fixed deposits. In that sense, the crypto rally was also because of a low-interest rate easy-money policy run in response to covid by central banks through much of the Western and developing world.\nAll these reasons basically explain why there is almost no hullabaloo on crypto this time around, despite a huge rise in prices.

Bitcoin surged 156% last year, after cratering 64% in 2022, though it remains still far off the record high of $69,000 it hit in November 2021.\n“The surge of enthusiasm for crypto comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission mulls applications for spot bitcoin ETFs,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNN.\n“Although it seems clear that crypto currencies are here to stay, and there is increasing appetite to add them to portfolios, the waiting game is still on for more regulated options for investors,” she added.\nKrystal Hur contributed reporting.","The dollar rose on the first trading day of the year, as attention turned to U.S. jobs data and European inflation numbers this week which may provide clues on central banks' next moves, while bitcoin rallied. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was last at 101.55, up 0.17%. It fell 2% in 2023, snapping two years of gains as investors weighed the prospect of the Fed cutting rates this year.\nOn the other side of the dollar's ascent was the euro which dipped 0.17% as traders digested data showing euro zone factory activity\ncontracted in December for an 18th straight month. The Japanese yen also struggled, with the dollar up 0.43% at 141.4 yen.\nA slew of economic data is due this week including European inflation data and U.S. data on job openings and non-farm payrolls, which will help shape market expectations regarding monetary policy moves from the Fed and European Central Bank.

Risk appetite was strong after global shares ended 2023 with their biggest annual rise in four years, driven by the prospect that major central banks globally could begin easing rates this year in a major boost for consumers and businesses shackled by high borrowing costs.\nAlso in a sign that the risk-on mood seen in December was extending into the new year, the world's largest cryptocurrency bitcoin stormed above $45,000 on Tuesday for the first time since April 2022. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.6% and was on track to post its steepest drop in a month, giving back some of its gains, having risen 4.5% in December. Still, it stood not too far from a five-month high hit last week.\nAustralia's S&P\/ASX 200 Index peaked at 7,632.70 points, its highest since August 2021. Japan markets were closed for a holiday, which meant there was no cash trading of Treasuries.\n\"We could see equity just keep going on its merry ascent and we need to be open-minded to all possibilities,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. \"But with fund manager sentiment the most upbeat since January 2022, cash levels having been reduced and many other signs of broad exuberance, it feels like the distribution for risk is becoming more evenly distributed.\"\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures added 0.57% while FTSE futures held largely steady.

CHINA CONUNDRUM\nIn Asia, a private-sector survey on Tuesday showed China's factory activity expanded at a quicker pace in December due to stronger gains in output and new orders, but business confidence for 2024 remained subdued. That contrasted with official data released over the weekend, which showed China's manufacturing activity shrank for a third straight month in December and weakened more than expected, clouding the outlook for the country's economic recovery and raising calls for further policy support.\nPresident Xi Jinping said on Sunday that China will enhance the positive trend of its economic recovery in 2024, and sustain long-term economic development with deeper reforms. Still, a mixed bag of data weighed on Chinese assets, with the onshore blue chip index sliding 1%. The index had slumped 11% in 2023.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.85%, having ended 2023 with a yearly loss of close to 14%, making it one of the world's worst performing stock markets. \"The divergence in manufacturing PMIs highlights how fragile the China recovery story is,\" said Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at OCBC.\n\"We continue to monitor if Chinese data shows signs of cracks or continue to point to signs of stabilisation.\" Elsewhere, oil prices jumped on Tuesday, with Brent crude futures and U.S. WTI crude futures each rising roughly 2%, due to potential supply disruptions in the Middle East after a naval clash in the Red Sea, among other things.\nBrent gained $1.56 to $78.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose $1.28 to $72.93.

While the central bank sees rate cuts on the horizon, it acknowledges that the road there is uncertain.\nIn addition, according to CNBC, Richmond Fed President Barkin warned that interest rate hikes remain \"on the table.\"\nBut the main reason for the weakness was speculation that the much-hyped Bitcoin ETF may not be approved this year as hoped.\nMany traders believe that an ETF would open up the cryptocurrency to a wider market, which would support the buy side of the equation.\nSo, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission decides not to approve the ETF, it would be a big blow to Bitcoin bulls.\nAnalysts at Bernstein don't believe these concerns are warranted. They commented:\n\"We continue to maintain that all price dips to the ETF are market opportunities to buy bitcoin\/bitcoin miners, and the market will likely bounce materially off the actual approval event (likely end of next week).\"\nCrypto investors may want to keep an eye out for more news on the proposed ETF next week.\nApril 9, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nYou may have heard Bitcoin referred to as ‘digital gold’.

Read Dr. Arnout ter Schure 's Market Analysis on Investing.com"],"article_contents":["There's currently a surge in cryptocurrency and phishing scams proliferating on X (formerly Twitter)—hiding under the guise of gold and gray checkmarks intended to mark \"Verified Organizations,\" reports have warned this week.\nThese scams seem to mostly commandeer dormant X accounts purchased online through dark web marketplaces, according to a whitepaper released by the digital threat monitoring platform CloudSEK. But the scams have also targeted high-profile X users who claim that they had enhanced security measures in place to protect against these hacks.\nThis suggests that X scammers are growing more sophisticated at a time when X has launched an effort to sell even more gold checks at lower prices through a basic tier announced this week.\nMost recently, the cyber threat intelligence company Mandiant—which is a subsidiary of Google—confirmed its X account was hijacked despite enabling two-factor authentication. According to Bleeping Computer, the hackers used Mandiant's account to \"distribute a fake airdrop that emptied cryptocurrency wallets.\"\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment on how many users may have been scammed, but Mandiant is investigating and promised to share results when its probe concludes.\nIn September, a similar fate befell Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who had his account hijacked by hackers. The bad actors posted a fake offer for free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a link to a fake website designed to empty cryptocurrency wallets. The post was only up for about 20 minutes but drained $691,000 in digital assets from Buterin's unsuspecting followers, according to CloudSEK's research.\nAnother group monitoring cryptocurrency and phishing scams linked to X accounts is MalwareHunterTeam (MHT), Bleeping Computer reported. This week, MHT has flagged additional scams targeting politicians' accounts, including a Canadian senator, Amina Gerba, and a Brazilian politician, Ubiratan Sanderson.\nOn X, gold ticks are supposed to reassure users that an account can be trusted by designating that an account is affiliated with an official organization or company. Gray ticks signify an account is linked to government organizations. CloudSEK estimated that hijacked gold and gray checks could be sold online for between $1,200 to $2,000, depending on how old the account is or how many followers it has. Bad actors can also buy accounts affiliated with gold accounts for $500 each.\nA CloudSEK spokesperson told Ars that its team is \"in the process of reporting the matter\" to X.\nX did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.\nCloudSEK predicted that scams involving gold checks would continue to be a problem so long as selling gold and gray checks remains profitable.\n\"It is evident that threat actors would not budge from such profit-making businesses anytime soon,\" CloudSEK's whitepaper said.\nFor organizations seeking to avoid being targeted by hackers on X, CloudSEK recommends strengthening brand monitoring on the platform, enhancing security settings, and closing out any dormant accounts. It's also wise for organizations to cease storing passwords in a browser, and instead use a password manager that's less vulnerable to malware attacks, CloudSEK said. Organizations on X may also want to monitor activity on any apps that become connected to X, Bleeping Computer advised.\nCloudSEK's spokesperson told Ars that its team started researching scams targeting verified organizations on X after coming across \"unique advertising on the dark web which talked exclusively\" about gold checks, as well as advertisements on social media platforms like Telegram and Facebook. Seeing so many ads focused on X gold checks raised a red flag for CloudSEK, which predicted that malicious campaigns that require X gold accounts were \"brooding on a large scale.\"\nInvestigating, CloudSEK used search tools to crawl the dark web and explore Facebook and Telegram, identifying relevant keywords to find ads selling \"Twitter Gold\" accounts.\nThe earliest ad that CloudSEK discovered was a request to buy a gold X account that was posted on a dark web marketplace in March 2023. The buyer made it clear how important the gold account would be to their operation, writing, \"I'll buy a legacy\/gold Twitter account … I need it every day and a lot.\"\nSome scammers were so bold that they openly advertised the names of companies whose X gold accounts had been hacked, CloudSEK reported. Other ads offered to boost followers on stolen accounts by up to 50,000 for an extra cost. According to CloudSEK, there's also an entire marketplace where hacked accounts could be resold.\nOne compromised X account with nearly 30,000 followers that had been inactive since 2016 was advertised for up to $2,500 on Telegram, CloudSEK reported.\nTo access verified X accounts, hackers use various methods, including manually creating accounts posing as verified organizations, brute-forcing existing accounts by using a \"generic username and password combo list,\" and using malware to harvest credentials from infected devices, CloudSEK reported.\nTypically, hackers target inactive accounts and then update them with the hacker's own information to lock out initial account holders. After an account takeover occurs, the hackers subscribe to X gold, and the stolen account is ready to be sold.\nBuyers pay for gold accounts through a guarantor, who holds their funds until the account is delivered. After that, buyers are guaranteed access to the X account with \"no hassles\" for 30 days. Should any problems arise with the first login, one ad flagged by CloudSEK said a replacement would be provided, but otherwise, \"all sales are final.\"\nCurrently, 30 days is the standard duration of an X gold subscription, but X is now advertising that annual subscriptions are \"coming soon.\" That means it's possible that any undetected malicious activity on a hijacked account could go on for much longer, possibly increasing the value of gold checks or incentivizing the black market to sell more checks.\nX owner Elon Musk has insisted that selling checkmarks on X is intended to decrease scams and impersonation, but reports this week suggest that users should still be cautious before trusting verified organizations on the platform.\nUntil X announces solutions for malicious activity flagged by cyber threat researchers this week, CloudSEK recommends tips for users wanting to double-check the authenticity of verified organizations on X before clicking any links.\nThe biggest clue for users that a gold account is hacked can be found in the account's pinned post. CloudSEK's team found that sometimes hijacked accounts leave a verified organization's bio information exactly as it appeared before the account was commandeered. That means the username will appear the same, and a legitimate website will be linked in the bio. However, the pinned post at the top of the account will likely be a \"misleading crypto advertisement asking followers to join.\"\nCloudSEK recommends that users treat any posts from a verified organization \"insisting\" that their followers \"join random channels based on crypto\" as suspicious. Often, these posts link X users to malicious domains that host the company's name but shift it to a different top-level domain than the company's legitimate website. Hovering over a link before clicking and comparing it to an organization's legitimate website could spare some X users from being scammed.\nWhile cryptocurrency scams on X appear to be more common, CloudSEK warned that bad actors are also hijacking X gold and gray accounts for other scams, including posting phishing links, disinformation campaigns, and financial scams.\nListing image:\n    \n      ALAIN JOCARD \/ Contributor | AFP",null,null]}

Some information may no longer be current.\nA raft of investment managers on Monday disclosed the fees they plan to charge for their proposed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), in another step toward approval this week by the U.S. securities regulator.\nBlackRock, VanEck, Ark Investments\/21Shares and Bitwise, among others, said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that they expect to significantly undercut the average market rate for U.S. ETFs as the battle for market share heats up ahead of an SEC approval deadline on Wednesday.\nBitwise came in the lowest at 0.24%, compared with the 0.54% average for U.S. ETF products, according to Morningstar, followed by VanEck at 0.25%. Ark and 21Shares lowered their planned fee to 0.25% from 0.80%, while BlackRock said it would charge 0.30%.\nFees are typically among the final details nailed down before an ETF launch. Market participants anticipate the SEC will approve the spot bitcoin ETFs this week in a watershed for the industry, which has been trying for a decade to bring the product to market.\n“This is unprecedented,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a data analytics firm. “Having a real race right out of the gate in that context is going to be ... dramatic and exciting.”\nThe SEC has previously rejected all spot bitcoin ETFs, citing investor protection concerns. Hopes it would finally approve the product surged last year after a federal appeals court ruled that the agency was wrong to reject Grayscale’s application to convert its existing Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which charges a 2% fee, into a spot bitcoin ETF.\nThe company said on Monday it would charge 1.5% for the proposed ETF, by far the highest of the fees so far disclosed.\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company had been in frequent contact with the SEC in recent months about the product.\n“It’s been very encouraging to work together to pave the way for these products to come to market,” he told Reuters in an interview.\nThe race to launch a spot bitcoin ETF has pitted crypto companies such as Grayscale Investments against traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock and Fidelity.\nBryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, said fees are one of the most important differentiators for a buy and hold investor. “There’s no reason to pay more for the same exposure,” he said.\nFor short-term speculators, though, liquidity will be more important than fees, said James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University’s business school.\nHopes the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF has helped shore up confidence in the crypto industry, which was rattled by the FTX meltdown and other crypto collapses last year.\nA spot bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it, drawing potentially billions more dollars into the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was last up 2.01% at $44,828.\nSome financial regulatory experts, including Washington advocacy group Better Markets, have said the crypto market is rampant with fraud and that approving the product would be a “historic mistake.”\nBe smart with your money.

For those who still doubt this paradigm, look no further than the price wars breaking across Wall Street over the imminent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nSome of our readers might be confused by all of the brouhaha over the launch of these spot Bitcoin ETFs, and rightfully so. After all, futures-based ETFs of the world's preeminent cryptocurrency already exist. However, Bitcoin's futures-based ETFs do suffer from material underperformance due to the fact that the contracts for the months ahead are usually priced at a premium to the spot price in what is known as contango, leading to progressively expensive roll-overs as the front-month contract expires and the next one takes its place. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, sidestep this major bottleneck entirely, leading to elevated investment inflow expectations.\nwe peg it at $48tn for wealth managers in the US https:\/\/t.co\/H9HXkRlELk pic.twitter.com\/KN6G4JtoAu\n— Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) January 7, 2024\nWealth managers in the US currently manage assets worth around $48 trillion. If just 1 percent of these assets are redeployed within the Bitcoin ecosystem courtesy of the upcoming spot ETFs, it would result in an investment inflow of nearly $500 billion! For context, Bitcoin's entire market capitalization is just around $864 billion at the moment. What's more, the amount of Bitcoin held within investment products, including ETPs and closed-end funds, stood at a measly $21.7 billion, as of the end of September 2023.\nThese numbers show the sizable scope of further investments within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that analysts appear to be tripping over each other in publishing a veritable litany of bullish targets for the world's preeminent cryptocurrency. For instance, AllianceBernstein now expects Bitcoin to hit $150,000 in 2025, courtesy of the launch of these new spot ETFs and the upcoming halving event in April 2024, when the reward for mining Bitcoin will again be cut in half in what is a regular 4-year cycle. Moreover, Bernstein analysts continue to expect Bitcoin to hit $80,000 by the end of 2024 and $150,000 in 2025.\nLast week, a half-baked report from Matrixport unleashed a brief episode of panic across the financial world when it claimed that the SEC would reject all spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January 2024 due to significant hurdles and uncertainties that might only be resolved by the second quarter of 2024.\nLook at the S-1 filings today\nThere are signed legal opinions, consents\nBlackrock ALREADY purchased seed Bitcoin\nBlackrock announced their fee undercut publicly\nThese things are getting approved this week with 100% odds\nI’m so stupidly long BTC right now lmfao ✌🏻🎌\n— kamikaz FIAT (@kamikaz_ETH) January 8, 2024\nSince then, however, we have witnessed one encouraging sign after the other, bolstering the financial community's confidence in betting on the imminent nature of the outstanding spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\nYeah it’s basically done.

Bloomberg previously reported that the SEC plans to vote in the coming days. https:\/\/t.co\/oHCYhKM2Le\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 8, 2024\nThese Form S-1s dropped just a few minutes back, showing a veritable price war brewing at Wall Street.\nBut wait, ARK just dropped their fee to 0.25% in an S-1 filed 20 minutes after BlackRock’s.

Damn. pic.twitter.com\/QVRhEXzLey\n— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 8, 2024\nGrayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has an expense ratio (fee) of just around 2 percent for managing assets that bear a market value of around $25 billion. This means that GBTC generates more income than the incredibly popular QQQ ETF! However, this free lunch of sorts is now at an end. Consider the fact that BlackRock would charge a fee of just 0.20 percent for the first 12 months or until it earns a total of $5 billion. Thereafter, the investment titan would charge a fee of 0.30 percent. Similarly, ARK Invest plans to charge a fee of 0.25 percent on its spot Bitcoin ETF. For comparison, the QQQ ETF bears an expense ratio of around 0.20 percent.\nI spoke too soon re: low-water mark!\nArk and 21Shares are going 0.25% and *NO FEE* for the first six months or until $1 billion in assets\nthese are very, very low numbers https:\/\/t.co\/zjCRNPJpts pic.twitter.com\/NrifnrAAWe\n— Katie Greifeld (@kgreifeld) January 8, 2024\nWhen compared with GBTC's previous haul, these are quite competitive numbers. Nonetheless, Grayscale appears to be resisting this trend, with its upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF charging an annual fee of 1.5 percent. While this is a notable step down from GBTC's 2 percent expense ratio, such an elevated fee level does relegate Grayscale's ETF to an outlier.\nBITCOIN ETF FEE WARS\nInvesco \/ Galaxy - 0 then 59 bpsBlackrock - 20 bps then 30 bpsBitwise - 0 then 24 bpsArk - 0 then 25 bps Fidelity - 39 bps Valkyrie - 80 bps Grayscale - 150 bps\n👀👀👀\nhave any others published yet?\n— Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem) January 8, 2024\nOf course, this brutal issuer competition is a win for investors, who get a competitive fee structure paired with the unmatched convenience of gaining exposure to Bitcoin via spot ETFs.","08th Jan, 2024. 05:51 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO SAR: Today’s Bitcoin price in Saudi Arabia on Feb 21, 2024\nAs of January 08, 2024, the Bitcoin market in Saudi Arabia reveals a current price of 168,756.14 SAR.

This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32mn new bitcoins will be held in spot US ETFs by end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote, estimating that inflows this year alone could be $50 billion-$100 billion.\nIf bitcoin reaches $200,000, that would represent a price surge of 344% from its current level of about $45,000.\nOnce up and running, these ETFs would cause demand to soar, providing enough price upside for bitcoin to potentially reach $100,000 before the end of 2024, Kendrick previously forecast.

Moments later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a post on his own account that the agency’s account was “compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted.”\nThe SEC followed up with a post reiterating Gensler’s statement. A spokesperson for the SEC also confirmed to CNBC that an “unknown party” had accessed its account.\nLate Tuesday night, an unsigned post sent from the @Safety account said, “Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X’s systems. but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.”\nLast week, a report from Bleeping Computer highlighted how hackers are increasingly targeting government or business profiles on X to promote crypto scams and phishing sites. Access to these accounts, which are identifiable by their gold (for business) and gray (for government profiles) checkmarks, are even up for sale on the dark web, according to a report from the cyberintelligence company CloudSEK.\nMandiant, the cybersecurity firm owned by Google, was just one of the high-profile accounts that had fallen victim to hackers, as its account was hijacked last week to advertise a crypto scam that drained users’ wallets. The blockchain security firm CertiK also had its account taken over earlier this week to post crypto phishing links.\nThe post from @Safety does not indicate X will adjust its security policies in light of these recent incidents.\nThe illegitimate post sent from the SEC’s account said, “Today the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities. The approved Bitcoin ETFs will be subject to ongoing surveillance and compliance measures to ensure continued investor protection.” It included an image of Gensler next to the quote, but it was clearly missing any link to the SEC’s website that would normally accompany this kind of news.\nWhoever compromised the SEC’s account also began liking posts from crypto-focused accounts that expressed excitement about the SEC’s false approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Even though the SEC’s fake post was only live for a matter of minutes, it still managed to trigger a steep spike in the price of Bitcoin that brought it from around $46,746 to $47,863. That price has since sunk to $45,633 at this time of writing, according to data from CoinDesk, though it’s since risen to $46,173.\nExchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are bundles of assets that work sort of like mutual funds, with shares of the ETFs trading on exchanges as stocks do. A Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for investors to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to hold Bitcoin directly. That also lets them avoid setting up their own cryptocurrency wallets and so on. The SEC has previously rejected all attempts at a Bitcoin ETF.\nUpdate January 9th, 7:15PM ET: Added new information from the SEC and an updated Bitcoin price.\nUpdate January 9th, 11:37PM ET: Added details posted by @Safety.","ASX resumes slide as iron ore giants fall; Alumina up 17pc\nWorley breaks silence after tribunal findings\nStephen Hiscock steps down as SG Hiscock CIO\nCryptocurrency animal spirits are back big time\nMagnis says battery cells claim was not true\nUranium small-cap to raise a further $10m\nJoshua Peach\nA sell-off in mining companies offset cooler-than-expected inflation data, driving the sharemarket lower on Wednesday.\nThe S&P\/ASX 200 dropped 52 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 7468 and the All Ordinaries fell by a similar margin.

The incident sparked an investigation by US authorities and renewed criticism of the SEC's cybersecurity and stance on cryptocurrencies, the report added.\nA highly anticipated decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund quickly morphed into a major cybersecurity incident on January 9.\nSoon after the SEC's X account was hacked, a fake announcement claimed the agency's approval of plans for certain products. This misinformation briefly pumped the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency and prompted U.S. authorities to launch an investigation into the breach of a social media account belonging to Wall Street's primary regulator.\nFollowed by the SEC assuring collaboration with law enforcement for an investigation, confirming the termination of unauthorized access, and disavowing the post as not originating from the SEC or its staff. Gensler separately clarified that no decision regarding ETFs had been reached, the report added.\nThe SEC disclosed unapproved activity on the @SECGov X account \"by an unknown party for a brief period shortly after 4 pm ET\" in January, the Bloomberg reported. Following the removal of the false post, Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, announced the account's security and ongoing root cause investigation.\nIn the backdrop of this incident, approximately a dozen companies have sought approval to list Bitcoin-backed ETFs in the U.S. The SEC has until Jan. 10 to act on at least one of these applications, leading to speculation among crypto insiders that a series of decisions might be announced around that date.\nBefore a spot-backed Bitcoin ETF can commence trading, two technical requirements must be met. Firstly, the SEC must approve the 19b-4 filings from the exchanges intending to list the ETFs. Secondly, the regulator must endorse the relevant S-1 forms, and the registration applications from potential issuers, including major entities like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity.\nReports suggested the SEC is planning to vote on the exchanges' filings, the 19b-4s, this week, with potential action on the issuers' applications, the S-1s, occurring around the same time. If the SEC grants both sets of required approvals, the ETFs could start trading as early as the next business day, as per the report.\nDespite past refusals under Gensler and his predecessor Jay Clayton, who cited investor protection and market manipulation concerns, speculation has risen since the SEC's legal setback against Grayscale Investments in August. This has led to expectations that the regulator may yield to the growing demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the report further explained.\nThis development came after the CEO of Ark Investment Management, Cathie Wood, shared her view on the potential spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an interview with CNBC. Her firm’s joint proposal with 21 shares was up for a decision on January 10, the first deadline for spot bitcoin ETF applications this year.\nCatch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

Though it still has some way to climb before retaking the all-time highs of US$68,790 notched on 11 November 2021.\nBut with the latest surge, the Bitcoin price has now gained an impressive 174% since this time last year.\nHere's what looks to be driving the latest gains.\nA range of financial companies have been trying to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) in the United States for many years now.\nThese ETFs will invest in the token directly, rather than via futures, more closely tracking the spot Bitcoin price.\nTo date, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has knocked back those applications due to the inherent risks of investing in crypto assets.\nBut the Bitcoin price has found renewed energy amid a pending decision from the SEC this week on whether the regulator should allow the ETFs to offer investors access to a stock market fund that invests directly in the crypto.\nSources say that if the SEC greenlights the applications, some funds could be launched as soon as next week.\nThe companies hoping to offer Bitcoin ETFs include BlackRock, Ark, Wisdom Tree, Invesco, Fidelity and Galaxy Digital.\nCommenting on the impact the pending SEC decision is having, Greg Moritz, co-founder of Alt Tab Capital said (quoted by Bloomberg), \"The bullish movement for Bitcoin is almost certainly a response to the very high likelihood that we see spot ETF approval this week.\"\nJad Comair, CEO of Melanion Capital agreed. Comair said (quoted by the Financial Times), \"With a Bitcoin spot ETF, we're opening the doors to Wall Street.\"\nMore broadly, the Bitcoin price has been enjoying tailwinds with investor expectations growing that the US Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates in 2024.\nWhen central banks began ratcheting up rates in early 2022, Bitcoin's performance proved similar to other high-risk, growth assets and plunged in value.\nIt's been a good 12 months for some of the other top cryptos as well, with the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) price up 81% over the full year.\nApril 9, 2025 |\n        Bernd Struben\nYou may have heard Bitcoin referred to as ‘digital gold’.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 applications, including from BlackRock, Ark Investments, 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco and VanEck, among others, according to a notice on its website. Some products are expected to begin trading as early as Thursday.\nThe products - a decade in the making - are a game-changer for bitcoin, offering institutional and retail investors exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without directly holding it, and a major boost for a crypto industry beset by a string of scandals. Standard Chartered analysts this week said the ETFs could draw $50 billion to $100 billion this year alone, potentially driving the price of bitcoin as high as $100,000. Other analysts have said inflows will be closer to $55 billion over five years.\n\"It's a huge positive for the institutionalization of bitcoin as an asset class,\" said Andrew Bond, managing director and senior fintech analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. \"The ETF approval will further legitimize bitcoin.\" Bitcoin was last up 2.13% at $46,924. Some analysts had noted that the market may have already priced in the news of approval - bitcoin had soared more than 70% in recent months on growing anticipation of an ETF, and hit its highest level since March 2022 earlier in the week.\nA green light marks a U-turn for the SEC, which for a decade rejected bitcoin ETFs due to worries they could be easily manipulated. SEC chair Gensler is also a fierce crypto skeptic. Hopes the SEC would finally approve bitcoin ETFs surged last year after a federal appeals court ruled that the agency was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale Investments to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. That ruling forced the agency to re-examine its position.\nIn a statement, Gensler said that in light of the court ruling, approving the products was \"the most sustainable path forward,\" but added the agency did not endorse bitcoin, which is risky and volatile. The crypto industry celebrated the news.\n\"Like many of Grayscale's future-forward investors, we believed that bitcoin could change the world, and we were and remain excited at the prospect of democratizing access to this asset through a U.S. regulated investment vehicle,\" said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein. Douglas Yones, head of exchange traded products at the New York Stock Exchange, where some products will be listed, said the approval was also an important \"milestone\" for the ETF industry.\nThe approvals come a day after an unauthorized person published a fake post on the SEC's account on social media platform X, saying the agency had approved the new products for trading. The agency quickly disavowed and deleted the post. On Wednesday it said it is coordinating with law enforcement including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the SEC's own internal watchdog to investigate the incident.\nFurther confusion ensued on Wednesday afternoon when the SEC posted a notice on its website appearing to show that the ETFs had been approved but then removed it, only to repost it again.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","Global stock indexes rose and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields edged up on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to a U.S. consumer price report for possible clues on when the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates. Late in the day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) to track bitcoin. Bitcoin has gained sharply in recent months on the expectation ETFs for the asset would be approved.\nInvestors are gearing up for the December consumer price index report due on Thursday. It is expected to show that headline inflation rose 0.2% in the month and by 3.2% on an annual basis., Investors are also anxious to see U.S. company quarterly results, which begin with reports from some of the big U.S. banks on Friday.\n\"There's still speculation about when the Fed may lower rates. I take them for their word - higher for longer,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York, adding that would depend on how fast inflation is coming down. \"It will be interesting to see earnings and also outlooks in this changing environment,\" he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.57 points, or 0.45%, to 37,695.73, the S&P 500 gained 26.95 points, or 0.57%, to 4,783.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.94 points, or 0.75%, to 14,969.65. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.18% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.37%.\nU.S. and European markets surged at the end of 2023 as inflation cooled more quickly than expected and central banks struck a softer tone, encouraging investors to bet on big rate cuts this year. In afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year yield rose 1.9 bps to 4.034%. A U.S. 10-year note auction showed a high yield of 4.024%, modestly higher than the market's forecast of around 4.19%, suggesting investors demanded a slight premium.\nBy late afternoon, the dollar index was down 0.14% at 102.36. Soft economic data this week in Japan may make it less likely that the Bank of Japan will raise rates out of negative territory this month.\nOil prices fell after an unexpected jump in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 87 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $71.37 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures fell 79 cents, or 1%, to settle at $76.80.

An SEC spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian in a statement that the unauthorized post on the @SECGov account “was not drafted or created by the SEC”.\n“The SEC continues to investigate the matter and is coordinating with appropriate law enforcement entities, including the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General and the FBI,” the spokesperson said. The FBI did not immediately respond to request for additional comment.\nX confirmed later on Tuesday, following a preliminary investigation, that the SEC’s account had been compromised because an unidentified individual gained control via a phone number associated with the account through a third party.\nThe false post on @SECGov said the securities regulator had approved exchange-traded funds to hold bitcoin. The widely anticipated move has been expected to give bitcoin more mainstream integration and boost investment – and the initial SEC tweet caused bitcoin’s price to spike nearly $48,000.\nThe SEC deleted the post about 30 minutes after it appeared, and the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, confirmed in a post shortly afterwards that the agency’s account had been compromised and that the tweet was “unauthorized”. “The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,” he said.\nHowever, on Wednesday the SEC did approve 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The approval is a gamechanger for bitcoin, offering institutional and retail investors exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without directly holding it, and a major boost for a crypto industry beset by a string of scandals such as the blockbuster trial and conviction of the FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and money laundering at cryptocurrency giant Binance.\n“Retail investors seeking exposure to bitcoin now have much easier and more direct access to the asset through many of the top financial institutions,” said Perianne Boring, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency and blockchain advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce. “This alone is a transformational event for hundreds of millions of investors and the bitcoin community.”\nReuters contributed to this story","Subscribe to gift this article\nGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.\nAlready a subscriber?\nBuying bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, a watershed moment for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.\nIn total, applications from 11 issuers got the green light from the SEC. A few of those issuers are listed below, along with the relevant fund names and proposed ticker symbols.\nArk Invest & 21Shares: Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\nBlackRock: iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC)\nFidelity: Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\nFranklin Templeton: Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\nInvesco & Galaxy: Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\nThe institutions listed above are especially relevant because they collectively have more than $10 trillion in assets under management, meaning their spot Bitcoin ETFs are well positioned to gain traction with retail and institutional investors. In fact, with the exception of Ark Invest, every issuer listed ranks among the 15 largest asset managers in the world, and BlackRock is the single largest.\nHere's what investors should know.\nThe SEC started approving Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. But those funds invest in Bitcoin futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell the cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In other words, Bitcoin futures ETFs do not own Bitcoin directly, so they do not track its price precisely. For instance ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT: BITO) -- the largest Bitcoin futures ETF -- returned 103% over the past year, but Bitcoin itself soared 170%.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs work differently. Issuers will purchase Bitcoin to build the fund and sell shares on the stock market. Those shares will track the price of Bitcoin precisely, giving investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying or storing it. By removing barriers to entry, spot Bitcoin ETFs could draw more investors and capital to the market, driving the price of Bitcoin higher.\nIndeed, analysts at Bernstein believe Bitcoin could triple in value by the end of 2025, and analysts at Standard Chartered Bank believe its price could quadruple during that time. Other financial professional are forecasting even greater upside.\nAsset prices are a function of supply and demand. Bitcoin is no different. But because its supply is limited to 21 million coins, demand is effectively the only variable that matters. In other words, whether Bitcoin becomes more or less valuable in the future depends entirely on whether demand increases or decreases.\nThe historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could drive a step-function increase in demand, especially with major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity participating as issuers. Spot Bitcoin ETFs will greatly reduce friction. Investors will no longer need to create and fund accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, nor will they need to worry about storing Bitcoin in a blockchain wallet. Instead, they will have the convenience of adding Bitcoin exposure to existing portfolios through traditional brokerages.\nWith that in mind, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani believes spot Bitcoin ETF approval could push the price of Bitcoin to $150,000 by 2025, implying 230% upside from its current price. Similarly, Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered Bank says the approval could send the price of Bitcoin to $200,000 by 2025. That implies 340% upside.\nEven more bullish is SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci. He believes spot Bitcoin ETF approval could attract $100 billion in institutional investments, driving the price of Bitcoin to $330,000 in the not-too-distant future. That implies 625% upside from its current price. Scaramucci pointed to the BlackRock ETF as being particularly compelling, simply because BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world.\nAs a caveat, investors should never put too much emphasis on price targets, and they should bear in mind that cryptocurrency is a volatile asset class fraught with regulatory uncertainty. Yet, the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs removes a bit of that uncertainty, and the launch of such products could certainly bring more capital to Bitcoin, pushing its price higher over time.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

That means Coinbase will be central to the storage and safekeeping of the assets for those firms.\nWhile custody revenue presents a big growth opportunity for Coinbase in the near term, some industry analysts are concerned that the company's core transaction business is at risk due to the myriad ways investors will be able to access bitcoin. Instead of having to go to an asset exchange such as Kraken, Binance, or Coinbase, they'll be able to invest in the digital currency through the same mechanism they already use to buy stock and bond ETFs.\nIn a report Dec. 4, analysts at Bernstein predicted that in less than five years, 10% of the global supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency, or roughly $300 billion, will be managed by ETFs. The firm called it the \"largest pipe ever built between traditional financial markets and crypto financial markets.\"\nIn 2023, Coinbase's stock was one of the top performers in the tech industry, soaring almost 400%. Much of that rally was tied to bitcoin, which increased 150%. But part of the outperformance relative to bitcoin was due to the excitement that new ETFs would drive more interest in crypto and be a boon for Coinbase.\n\"ETFs should expand the pie and bring new people and institutions into the cryptoeconomy,\" Coinbase Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi said on the company's most recent earnings call in November. \"They should add credibility to the market, and we should see increased liquidity and market stability as we've seen with other asset classes such as gold.\"\nFrom June 15, the day that BlackRock — with its $9 trillion in assets under management — filed for a so-called spot bitcoin ETF and named Coinbase its crypto custodian, shares in the exchange rose from around $54 to over $170 by the end of the year.\nJPMorgan analysts wrote in a November report that Coinbase would be a key beneficiary of the coming ETF boom, given the immediate upside of custody fees from asset managers.\n\"We estimate Bitcoin custody and surveillance revenue will more than offset decline in Bitcoin trading volume as assets migrate to ETFs,\" the analysts said.\nSome of the momentum on Wall Street has faded to start 2024, with the stock down 14% since the calendar turned. According to Mizuho analysts, there could be more pain to come.\n\"With the hype around Bitcoin ETFs likely to reach a climax in the coming weeks, COIN bulls could experience a rough awakening when they realize how minimal the revenue impact is,\" Mizuho wrote in a note Thursday.\nMizuho's analysts have the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock and were bearish throughout last year's rally, finishing 2023 with a $54 price target, by far the lowest among analysts tracked by FactSet.\nAlmost half of Coinbase's revenue comes from the fees it charges on transactions, meaning the company needs people to keep using the exchange to buy and trade bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nIn the third quarter in 2023, total transaction revenue accounted for 46% of net revenue. However, Coinbase has been diversifying into new businesses. In 2022, transactions made up closer to 75% of revenue.\nMore than one-quarter of Coinbase's revenue in the third quarter came from interest income on the exchange's stablecoin reserves, including Circle's U.S. dollar-pegged USDC coin. Stablecoin revenue more than doubled from a year earlier primarily due to rising interest rates.\n\"A few years ago, our business at Coinbase was 95% trading fees, and we made a big effort around the time it went public to start diversifying our revenue,\" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a recent interview. \"What's great is that now we have multiple sources of revenue — some of them in a high interest rate environment go up, some of them in a low interest rate environment go up.\"\nStill, transaction fees remain a key income driver for the exchange. And unlike trading platform Robinhood, which enables investments in a wide array of asset types, Coinbase doesn't allow for trading of ETFs.\n\"Spot bitcoin ETFs appear poised to take volume away from crypto exchanges,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.\nJPMorgan anticipates that new account growth will slow as \"novice crypto investors get their initial exposure and possibly final exposure through ETFs rather than Coinbase,\" adding that many of these neophyte traders will never go beyond bitcoin, \"thus never needing the services of a Coinbase.\"\nMizuho sees the income from custody fees as fairly modest given how far investors have pushed up the stock. The firm predicts ETF approval may add just $25 million to $30 million in annual custody fees, with another $200 million to $210 million of new revenue \"if incremental Bitcoin inflows generate additional spot trading opportunities.\"\nWith a collective gain of up to $240 million in additional annual revenue, \"this represents just mid-to-high single-digit percentage upside vs. current 2024 consensus,\" the Mizuho analysts wrote. They said they \"do not believe the nearly 400% increase in the stock in anticipation of ETF approval justifies our reasonable estimate for the ETFs' actual contribution to revenue.\"\nA Coinbase spokesperson told CNBC in an emailed statement that, in addition to custody fees, the company will make money by providing services such as agency trading, matching and settlement, and financing to ETF issuers.\n\"The platform believes that spot ETFs will be a positive catalyst for the entire crypto space, adding credibility, increasing liquidity, and bringing new participants and institutions into the cryptoeconomy,\" the spokesperson said, reiterating prior comments from Coinbase executives.\nCompetition could also create pricing pressure.\nARK, Invesco, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie are all offering deals that involve fee-free trading for a certain period of time. Others are opting for discounted fees.\nCoinbase's transaction fee varies, with a max of 0.6% on transactions up to $10,000 in value. In the company's most recent quarterly earnings call, Choi said that Coinbase doesn't plan to reduce transaction fees to make them more competitive with other platforms where ETFs are being traded at significantly lower prices.\nThe transaction charges on Coinbase also vary between its Pro platform and the retail app, where fees are higher. For retail transactions up to $1,000, the fee ranges from 1.5% to 3%.\nHowever, JPMorgan analysts said greater efficiency and transparency in equity markets, paired with lower costs to execute, could drive more cryptocurrency trading to ETFs over time, which could ultimately \"pressure Coinbase to lower commissions and to narrow trading spreads, reversing the multi-quarter increase we've witnessed in Coinbase's retail revenue capture.\"\nStill, Coinbase has its believers among crypto enthusiasts, such as Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures.\n\"They are essential infrastructure in terms of custody, trading, and surveillance for the majority of the ETF proposals,\" Carter said. \"Even though it might affect their fees at the margin I think they are still winners here.\"\nWATCH: Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton on changes in bitcoin trading","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nBy Hannah Lang\n(Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of bitcoin in a game-changer for the cryptocurrency industry which has been trying for more than a decade to launch such a product.\nMultiple asset managers have applied for bitcoin ETFs since 2013, but the SEC rejected them on the grounds they would be vulnerable to market manipulation. In August, however, a court found the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale Investments' bitcoin ETF application, forcing the agency to rethink its stance.\nOn Wednesday, SEC approved applications from ARK Investments, BlackRock and Fidelity, among others. Here is how the products work and why the approval is seen as a big deal:\nHOW WILL THE ETFS WORK?\nThey will be listed on Nasdaq, NYSE and the CBOE. Their assets will comprise physical bitcoin purchased from crypto exchanges and held via custodians like Coinbase Global.\nThe products track a bitcoin benchmark. Some track an index provided by CF Benchmarks, a subsidiary of crypto exchange Kraken, which aggregates trading data from multiple Bitcoin-USD markets operated by big cryptocurrency exchanges.\nTo address the SEC's manipulation concerns, Nasdaq and CBOE have created a market surveillance mechanism with Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.\nIssuers plan to charge fees ranging from 0.20% to 0.8%, well below the broader ETF market average.\nIS IT DIFFERENT TO BUYING BITCOIN OUTRIGHT?\nYes. A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the price of bitcoin without the complications and risks of owning bitcoin directly. Those include setting up crypto wallets and accounts with crypto exchanges, some of which have poor cyber security records and are prone to hacks.\nThe industry has also experienced a string of bankruptcies and scandals, including the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud.\nOther exchanges have been accused of flouting U.S. securities laws, while Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, recently pleaded guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws. All this continues to make many investors wary.\nIn contrast, ETFs are listed on tightly-regulated stock exchanges and are therefore accessible through retail investors' existing brokerage accounts, which are also closely supervised.\nThe ETF structure also boosts the accessibility of bitcoin for institutional investors, some of whom are barred from investing directly in alternative assets.\nWHY IS IT DIFFERENT TO EXISTING BITCOIN FUTURES ETFS?\nThe SEC in 2021 approved bitcoin futures ETF, which track agreements to buy or sell bitcoin at a pre-agreed price. But those products don't track price movements precisely, and the cost of rolling over futures contracts can eat into returns, making them less desirable for many investors.\nAREN'T THERE SPOT BITCOIN ETFS IN CANADA AND EUROPE?\nYes. But the United States is the world's largest capital market, home to some of the globe's largest asset managers and institutional investors.\nHOW MUCH WOULD A BITCOIN ETF REEL IN?\nIt's unclear. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first bitcoin futures ETF approved by the SEC in 2021, saw around $1 billion worth of shares trading hands on its first day, and some experts believe a spot bitcoin ETF could net three times that much on its first day. That figure could balloon to $55 billion over five years, some expert estimate.\nWhile bitcoin has gained 70% since the Grayscale ruling, analysts said it was unclear how much further it would rise, with some saying interest rates would play a bigger role.\nBUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY\nFor the crypto industry, a spot bitcoin ETF is a big win, boosting the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry and pushing bitcoin further into the mainstream.\nIt also comes amid a broader tug-of-war between the crypto industry and SEC, which has been cracking down on the sector. When it comes to this particular battle, the industry can claim victory.\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington and Suzanne McGee in ProvidenceEditing by Michelle Price and Nick Zieminski)","This article was published more than 1 year ago.

Rumors started swirling around last week that approvals were coming, which sources confirmed.\nBut the road to approval was not a smooth one. On Tuesday, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account was hacked, a spokesperson confirmed with TechCrunch. This was a huge problem because the government’s account put out an “unauthorized” post that the agency granted approval for “bitcoin ETFs.”\nThe post was up for about 30 minutes, causing a number of news outlets and online personalities to report that the SEC granted approval for the highly anticipated spot bitcoin ETFs. The unauthorized post has since been deleted.\nBut all's well that ends well. Fast-forward to Wednesday and the SEC approved the first spot bitcoin ETF applications for 11 issuers (TC+). I spoke with two executives from Grayscale and Valkyrie about what’s in store for their spot bitcoin ETFs.\nRead about it here:\nValkyrie co-founder expects $10B inflows for spot bitcoin ETFs by end of year (TC+)\nGrayscale CEO sees spot bitcoin ETF as first step towards 'normalizing' crypto (TC+)\nThursday morning trading for the spot bitcoin ETFs began and brought in around $2 billion in total trading volume, VanEck’s head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel said.\nPrior to this, Valkyrie’s co-founder Steven McClurg told TechCrunch he expected about $2 billion to $3 billion in trading volume the first week, so this initial inflow may be signaling that the demand may become bigger than originally anticipated.\nNote: Other than the regularly scheduled newsletter bits, I'll be playing around with some recurring segments and features.

The company was founded in 2014 and is one of the world’s largest digital asset currency managers. The GBTC fund holds over 3% of the outstanding bitcoin supply, worth tens of billions of dollars.\nThe firm and its executives have made headlines in the past for their tenacious efforts to get their bitcoin spot ETF approved after it was originally denied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2022 and later the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of it. And now, Grayscale’s bitcoin spot ETF was approved.\nWe dive into what a spot bitcoin ETF approval means for GBTC and market demand.

Iris Energy fell 6% and CleanSpark lost 7%.\nInvestors were taking profits after the price of bitcoin briefly spiked above $49,000 for the first time since December 2021. It has since pulled back to around $46,000.\nMiners were some of the biggest gainers in the stock market in 2023. Marathon finished last year higher by almost 590%, while Riot rose more than 350%. CleanSpark and Iris Energy both posted gains of more than 400%.\nMiner revenue has also fallen in recent weeks as bitcoin transaction fees eased, according to data from CryptoQuant. Fees were extremely high for most of December due to high transaction activity on the network but have since cooled, which affects the mining companies' revenue, CryptoQuant's Julio Moreno explained.\nSome investors may also be positioning for the upcoming Bitcoin halving, when the mining reward for mining bitcoin, and mining companies' revenue, will be cut in half, per the Bitcoin code.\nThe halving, expected in April, is a market clearing event for miners. Although it historically precedes big gains in bitcoin — which typically benefit mining stocks — the event could push unprofitable miners out of the market, allowing more sustainable miners to gain market share.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","FILE - An advertisement for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin displayed on a tram, May 12, 2021, in Hong Kong. U.S. regulators are soon expected to decide whether to approve the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund, a development that could thrust the once niche and nerdy corner of the internet even further into the financial mainstream. (AP Photo\/Kin Cheung, File)\nFILE - The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters, June 19, 2015, in Washington. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024, that a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, announcing that the securities regulator had approved the trading of exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin was fake, and that the agency’s account had been “compromised.” (AP Photo\/Andrew Harnik, File)\nNEW YORK (AP) — Nearly a dozen new bitcoin funds began trading in U.S. markets for the first time Thursday, providing increased access to the cryptocurrency for everyday investors.\nThe new exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, give investors an asset that closely tracks the price of bitcoin.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 funds from asset managers such as Blackrock, Invesco and Fidelity late Wednesday. The wave of approvals may work in your favor as fund managers seek to attract investors by competing on fees.\nBesides being a win for the fund managers, the approvals are also a win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has needed a victory after nearly two years of turmoil, including the failure of several crypto firms, most notably FTX in November 2022.\nThe SEC’s approval, however, was lukewarm at best. Gary Gensler, the agency’s chairman, has repeatedly said cryptocurrencies need more regulation and investor protections.\n“Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,” Gensler said.\nThe regulatory greenlight had been anticipated for several months, however, and the price of bitcoin has jumped about 70% since October on the belief that bitcoin ETFs will drive up demand for the cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin rose 2% in early trading Thursday, and trading in the new ETFs was mixed.\nSome analysts think that ETFs may help stabilize crypto prices by broadening their use and potential audience. But many remain concerned that crypto ETFs will place too much risk and volatility into Americans’ retirement accounts.\n“The notorious price volatility of bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks,” said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody’s Analytics.\nHere are some things to know about bitcoin ETFs.\nWHY ALL THE EXCITEMENT OVER A BITCOIN ETF?\nAn exchange traded fund, or ETF, is an easy way to invest in something or a group of things, like gold or junk bonds, without having to take possession of those assets. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\nSince the inception of bitcoin, anyone wanting to own one would have to buy it. That in turn would mean either having to learn what a cold wallet is or having to open an account at a crypto trading platform like Coinbase or Binance.\nA spot bitcoin ETF could open the door to many new investors who don’t want to take such extra steps.\nThe price of bitcoin has already soared in anticipation of the SEC’s approval, with bitcoin trading at $47,500 Thursday, up from around $27,000 in mid-October. The price had sunk as low as $16,000 in November of 2022 following the implosion of the crypto exchange FTX.\nHOW WOULD THE ETF WORK?\nNew bitcoin ETFs will perform like the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which allows anyone to invest in gold without having to find someplace to store a bar or having to protect it. It’s the same reason some people invest in the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), which lets investors simply buy one thing instead of the more than 1,000 low-quality bonds that make up the index.\nThe Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has been in existence since 2021, but it holds futures related to bitcoin, not the cryptocurrency itself. Those prices do not track as closely as a straight-up bitcoin ETF.\nHOW MANY BITCOIN ETFS COULD THERE BE?\nThe SEC said it gave approval to 11 ETFs, but more are certain to apply for trading in the coming months.\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF AN ETF?\nLongtime crypto fans might object. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were created in part due to mistrust of the traditional financial system. Wall Street would become an intermediary between investors and cryptocurrency in the case of ETFs.\nETFs also charge fees, though they tend to be relatively low compared with the overall financial industry. These fees are shown through what’s called the expense ratio, which indicates how much of a fund’s assets the ETF will take each year to cover its costs.\nWHEN IS IT BETTER TO HOLD ACTUAL BITCOIN?\nAn ETF will not put actual cryptocurrency into investors’ accounts, meaning that they cannot use it. Also, an ETF would not provide investors with the same anonymity that crypto does, one of the big draws for many crypto investors.\nWHAT CONCERNS SHOULD INVESTORS HAVE?\nThe biggest concern for an investor in one of these ETFs is the notorious volatility in the price of bitcoin.\nDespite failing to catch on as a replacement for fiat, or paper, currencies, bitcoin soared near $68,000 in November of 2021. A year later it plunged below $20,000 as investors shunned riskier assets and a series of company blowups and scandals shook faith in the crypto industry.\nEven as regulators and law enforcement crack down on some of cryptos bad actors, like Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, the industry still has a “Wild West” feel to it.\nA hack of the SEC’s X account this week, when a fake tweet claimed the ETFs had been approved, sent prices soaring and raised questions about both the ability of scammers to manipulate the market and the SEC’s ability to stop them.","The United States-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw substantial trading activity, with $4.6 billion worth of shares changing hands by Thursday afternoon, according to LSEG data. This followed the landmark approval by the US securities regulator on January 10, marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry, testing the acceptance of digital assets as investments.\nEleven spot bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, commenced trading on January 11 morning, leading to a competitive battle for market share, Reuters reported. Notably, Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity dominated trading volumes, as indicated by LSEG data.\nAlso Read | TCS, Infosys Q3 Results: Here's how both stocks are likely to open today\n\"Trading volumes have been relatively strong for new ETF products,\" Todd Rosenbluth, strategist at VettaFi told the publication. However, he emphasised that this is a longer-term race beyond a single day's trading.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval on January 10 came after a decade-long struggle with the crypto industry. Despite the green light, some executives warned of bitcoin's high-risk nature, and Vanguard, the largest mutual fund provider, stated it had no plans to offer the new spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform.\nAlso Read | TCS Q3 result: Tepid growth in revenue, profit to dividend announcement - here are 5 key highlights\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that the approvals were not an endorsement of Bitcoin, describing it as a \"speculative, volatile asset.\"\nThe ETF launches led to a surge in bitcoin prices, reaching the highest level since December 2021. Bitcoin was last up 0.77 percent at $46,303, while the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, rose 2.79 percent to $2597.95.\nIntense competition ensued among issuers, with some slashing fees below the industry standard. Fees on the new bitcoin ETFs range from 0.2-1.5 percent, and several firms offered to waive fees for a specific period or dollar volume of assets.\nEstimates for the potential inflow into spot bitcoin ETFs vary widely, with analysts projecting flows to surpass $10 billion in 2024 or potentially reaching $50 billion to $100 billion in 2023 alone, as per the report. However, some cautionary notes highlight the broader investment community's perception of cryptocurrencies as risky.\nAlso Read | World markets today: US stocks mixed after inflation data, crypto shares surge on spot Bitcoin ETF approval\nCryptocurrency-related stocks initially climbed but ended lower, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital dropping 15.8 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively.

Indeed, Bitcoin fans are rejoicing after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications on Wednesday.\nSo, what do you need to know about Bitcoin’s latest major win?\nWell, after years of waiting, it seems the SEC has finally given in and accepted the digital currency future. Indeed, spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that allow direct exposure to Bitcoin as part of  a standard brokerage account. Unlike other products that track Bitcoin futures, a spot Bitcoin invests directly into the cryptocurrency, rather than derivative contracts.\nCrypto investors have long been pounding the table over the potential of Bitcoin ETFs, perhaps reasonably so. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer an accessible and direct way for investors to tap into the growing crypto trend.\nSpot Bitcoin products operate by owning entire Bitcoins in a sort of digital vault, managed by registered operators. This allows the fund to mirror the movements of BTC in the market.\nCompared to digital wallets, tracking the crypto from the comfort of standard brokerage accounts is far more convenient. Some investors believe this will prove a major benefit to the crypto itself.\nSo, what are the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs?\nThe SEC has approved the following list of spot Bitcoin securities:\n“The approval has the potential to simplify and secure Bitcoin investments for a broader investor base, which may reshape the dynamics of cryptocurrency investments,” Rajeev Bamra, Senior Vice-President of digital finance at Moody’s, told Reuters.\nAll eyes are on Bitcoin today. Despite this, the crypto is actually down on the day. Indeed, BTC is in the red 1.35% since midnight. Though, given the crypto has surged more than 70% in the past few months ahead of the ETF launch, today may just be some stage shyness.\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A Bitcoin ETF is managed by an investment firm and listed on a traditional stock exchange.\nWhile it’s down from its November 2021 all-time high, Bitcoin has increased substantially in anticipation of the ETF approvals. Naturally, the increase in price has both individual and institutional investors wondering how they can get in on the action.\nTrading directly through a crypto exchange can be complicated for some investors. But with the introduction of ETFs tied to Bitcoin, the process of investing could become much simpler.\n“Investors will now be able to benefit from the added protections of the ETF structure and get Bitcoin exposure as part of a diversified portfolio with less volatility,” said Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at Wealthfront.\nThe SEC approved applications from 11 asset managers to list spot Bitcoin ETFs. Many of the funds cut their fees leading up to the approvals in an effort to win early investors.\nInvesting in a Bitcoin ETF could be a good option for people who are looking for a more traditional way of investing in the digital currency. Investing directly in Bitcoin can be complicated and involves questions of how the asset will be stored and which exchange to purchase on. ETFs remove some of that complexity by packaging Bitcoin into ETF form.\nThe ETF structure could also make it easier for some institutional investors to enter the crypto market, which could help keep demand for Bitcoin high.\nStill, Bitcoin is a high-risk investment with a very short trading history and no underlying cash flows to support its value.\n“Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that’s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,” Gensler said.\nBitcoin ETFs are available through most online brokers who offer traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Some of these brokers may also offer the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin directly, while others only allow you to trade Bitcoin futures.\nETFs trade on traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. If you’re interested in the widest offering of cryptocurrencies and are looking to directly invest in digital coins, you’ll need an account with a crypto exchange, such as Binance or Kraken, but these exchanges find themselves in the regulatory crosshairs of the SEC.\nETF\nTicker\nExpense ratio\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF\nBITB\n0.0 percent (0.20 percent)*\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF\nARKB\n0.0 percent (0.21 percent)*\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust\nFBTC\n0.0 percent (0.25 percent)*\nWisdom Tree Bitcoin Fund\nBTCW\n0.0 percent (0.30 percent)*\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\nBTCO\n0.0 percent (0.39 percent)*\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund\nBRRR\n0.0 percent (0.49 percent)*\niShares Bitcoin Trust\nIBIT\n0.12 percent (0.25 percent)*\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust\nHODL\n0.25 percent\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF\nEZBC\n0.29 percent\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust\nGBTC\n1.50 percent\nSource: Bloomberg\n*Note: Bitwise, ARK, WisdomTree to waive fee for first six months and\/or $1 billion in assets.

Some brokers offer a limited number of options for investing in crypto, typically offering only the major coins. If you’re looking for a broad offering, you’ll need to go through a crypto exchange, but be careful to watch out for costly fees associated with buying and selling.\nAnother way to make crypto-adjacent investments is to invest in ETFs focused on blockchain, which is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies that are using blockchain technology as part of their current and future business plans. Holdings often include a combination of crypto companies, tech giants and financial institutions.\nThere is also the option of investing in stocks of companies that are directly involved in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, a large crypto exchange, went public in 2021 and other companies such as PayPal and Robinhood have also made a push into cryptocurrencies. Be sure to thoroughly research each company and understand how much of their business is tied to crypto before investing.\nTraders eagerly awaiting a Bitcoin ETF got their wish in 2024 after the SEC approved the applications for several funds that invest directly in Bitcoin. There are also other ways to get in on the crypto action through stocks and ETFs that are indirectly tied to crypto or blockchain technology. You can also invest directly through a crypto exchange.\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

The positive momentum is anticipated to extend beyond Bitcoin to other tokens, signaling a broader resurgence in the overall crypto market. On an industry level, the implications are profound, promising long-term benefits that drive mass adoption. The approval opens doors for retail investors, simplifying their access to Bitcoin transactions through traditional brokerage accounts,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder, CoinDCX.\nFrom an institutional perspective, Gupta said, this development marks the inception of the first institutional bull market in crypto.\n“The spot Bitcoin ETF is poised to streamline exposure for traditional players, paving the way for the influx of trillions in institutional capital.

Is it being used as a payment anywhere? Are we buying cups of coffee with it? Not really. The only payment mechanism it’s being used for in a primary sense is illicit activity,” Gensler added.\nTrading activity topped $900 million in early trading Friday after the ETFs debuted with approximately $4.6 billion in volume a day earlier, The Block reported, citing Reuters and Yahoo Finance data.\nOther Wall Street firms are taking a wait-and-see approach to the ETFs, which have been called a high-risk investment by critics other than Gensler. Asset management giant Vanguard will not offer the ETFs to their clients.\nMerrill Lynch, Edward Jones and Northwestern Mutual also do not have immediate plans to offer the 11 approved ETFs, Fox Business reported.\nElsewhere, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission warned local investors that the US bitcoin ETFs may violate the its domestic laws on digital assets.\nThe price of bitcoin spiked above the $46,000 threshold following Wednesday’s ETF approvals — its highest level since December 2021.\nThe gains had pared somewhat by Friday, with bitcoin down nearly 6% to $44,502 as of the late morning, according to Coinbase data.\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described the first day of bitcoin ETF as a “huge success.”\n“By all metrics: volume, # of trades, flows, media coverage it was smashing success, historical,” Balchunas wrote on X. “And that was DESPITE limited platform availability.”\nAdvertisement","TORONTO — The price of Bitcoin hit highs this week not seen in more than two years after a U.S. regulator approved 11 exchange-traded funds linked to the cryptocurrency, prompting calls that it's a new era for digital money, but also for caution among investors.\nIn approving the ETFs by the likes of BlackRock Inc. and Franklin Templeton, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said the move does not mean any approval or endorsement of the cryptocurrency.\n\"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" he said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe latest news does little to alter the equation on whether to invest in the cryptocurrency, said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at BMO Global Asset Management.\n\"Nothing has changed from the reason of why you would want to own it, or why you wouldn't want it.\"\nThe option does make it easier and cheaper for U.S. investors to buy into bitcoin, helping drive more interest, he said.

Today, chef Isaac Ball faces our Cheap Eats questions - while you can scroll down to read news of gold hitting a record high, a Starbucks discount tip and a remote island installing its first ATM.\nThursday 17 April 2025 19:51, UK\nBusiness leaders have warned the government that plans for a new bill will lead to widespread strike action and damage the economy.\nCritics argue that the Employment Rights Bill will make it easier for trade unions to put their members on strike by weakening thresholds needed to trigger a walkout.\nThe bill could scrap the requirement that unions have at least half of their membership participate in strike votes before calling industrial action.\nA letter, signed by the \"B5\" club of business groups - made up of the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, Federation of Small Businesses, Institute of Directors and Make UK - says: \"Many businesses work well with their trade unions, but some are faced with unions behaving unreasonably.\n\"By empowering trade unions rather than empowering whichever party is behaving reasonably, this legislation will guarantee continued conflict and prevent the reset in industrial relations that is needed.\"\nBut union bosses say changes would bring voting methods into the 21st century and wouldn't harm discussions between them, companies and the government.\nWhat's in the bill?\nWhat do you think about the proposed changes?\nLet us know in the comments box at the top of this page.\nToday and tomorrow, Starbucks stores across the UK are offering customers who have their rewards app free reusable coffee cups.\nThe cups are available to new and existing Starbucks Rewards members who also buy a grande-sized iced drink over the next two days (a cold americano that size costs about £3.40, for context).\nThe cups sell for around £7 online, and if you bring them to stores going forward, you'll save 25p for each drink you buy.\nA word of warning, the last time the coffee chain did a promotion like this last year saw all of the cups run out fairly quickly - so it might be an idea to get there sooner rather than later.\nBy Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporter\nWe're in a world where the biggest economies are fighting a trade war, and because of that interest rates are expected to come down faster.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has gone first and cut rates by 0.25 percentage points.\nIt expects inflation across countries using the euro to continue to fall, in part because of Donald Trump's tariffs.\nIt's not for a good reason, though; the deflation is anticipated because of slowing European economies being hit by the taxes on their exports to the US.\nRate cuts are to come in the UK next month, where the Bank of England is forecast to bring the borrowing rate down to 4.25%.\nWe always love hearing from our readers, but it's particularly nice when you get in touch to share positive stories.\nAfter comedian John Bishop praised easyJet for its great customer service earlier this week, many of you got in touch to do the same...\nJust done the easyJet fear of flying course. It was excellent - everyone was so lovely, two captains flew with us and everything - noises, sensations etc - were explained thoroughly. Have flown since and looking forward to Australia next year, changed my life.\nShirley\nI booked with easyJet a couple of years ago and mixed up my dates by putting my departure date as the return date and vice versa. I called their customer service and they changed it immediately over the phone. No problem and no charge. Not like the other budget airlines.\nRobbie\nI also had a brilliant response from the easyJet Bordeaux ground team who helped me recover my purse from the petrol station when I filled up my hire car before returning it. Helped me recover it and got me a cab to collect it. Thanked them online at the time.\nBordeaux traveller\nOthers praised the budget airline, but suggested some changes it could make...\nLove easyJet but please keep all goodies stocked up. For example, perfumes and suchlike are always sold out. To be fair, if a price is a good price, then you should order more stock. Other than that never never never had any problems. Staff are fab, food is decent and flights smooth\nLisa\nNever had a problem with easyJet. They do have delays of an hour or more which are very tiring and frustrating. It's the airport staff that are the worst. Poor attitudes. Because of the delays and staff attitudes I won't fly anymore. I use Brittany Ferries and drive. More fun.\nTonbar\nWe also got some advice from customer feedback company Avius...\nIn terms of positive customer service stories, if you correct a negative guest experience, that guest will have a higher satisfaction with your company than a guest who never has a complaint event.\nBen, chief executive\nBut there was one reader who could only sigh...\nJeez, you'd think John Bishop had invented positive feedback. It's a sad reflection of the world we live in that it's such a big story. Toxic attitudes come from within and is the most dangerous disease we allow ourselves to be infected with. FFS! Be. The. Change.\nNorman\nBy Sarah Taaffe-Maguire, business and economics reporter\nThe UK's benchmark stock index had been on track to recover all the losses incurred since Donald Trump announced his tariffs on 2 April, but the FTSE 100 index of most valuable companies on the London Stock Exchange dropped 0.67% this morning.\nIt means the FTSE 100 still has some way to go before making up for all the market turmoil the tariffs caused.\nThe larger FTSE 250 index, comprised of more UK-based businesses,  is in a similar spot, recording a 0.5% drop so far today.\nThe pound is performing well at $1.32, ever so slightly below a six-month high.\nIt's a different picture against the euro, though, with a pound buying only €1.164 - far below the €1.20 rate just before the recent market tumult.\nWorries of lower oil production from Iran, caused by US sanctions, sent the oil price ticking up.\nHowever, a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark oil price, is still well below last year's average at $66.38.\nThis morning saw gold rocket to yet another record high, as investors seek to use the \"safe haven\" amid a turbulent market.\nFor the first time ever, gold cost $3,354.6 an ounce in the early hours of the morning.\nThat climb has been somewhat blunted this morning as some investors sold off their earnings, but prices remain very high.\nWhat's behind gold's price rise?\nGold has risen nearly $700 this year, with Donald Trump's tariff disputes, expectations of interest rate cuts and strong central bank buying fuelling its increases.\n\"Gold remains heavily supported by a broadly weaker dollar, uncertainty around tariff announcements and fears about a global recession,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM said of yesterday's rises.\nWhat is a safe haven?\nGold is what's known as a \"safe haven\" for investors - as it's an asset that typically retains or increases in value during times of market turbulence or economic uncertainty.\nInvestors typically flock to safe havens to protect their capital from losses when markets are volatile - as they are right now.\nIn Italy and fancy venturing to Venice for the day? On Friday and on other selected dates, that will cost you £8.\nVenice became the first city to start charging daytrippers for entry on key dates last year, though Italy has had a tourist tax (charged per night) in many hotspots for some time.\nTo enter the city of water on Good Friday, as well as more than 50 other key dates over the spring and summer, you must pay the \"Venice Access Fee\", which has doubled for tourists from €5 (£4.30) to €10 (£8.60).\nThe scheme is in place to protect the city from overtourism, with the majority of the millions of visitors only stopping for the day.\nAnyone planning on heading into the city between 8.30am and 4pm on the prescribed dates must register online, in advance, here.\nThere are a few exceptions, with those under 14 or who live or study locally among those who do not have to pay, but virtually all daytripping tourists will be caught out by the charge - unless they visit after 4.30pm of course.\nIf you're staying overnight in Venice, you're exempt (though you'll likely be paying an accommodation charge anyway), but you must also register (for free) and be able to prove you're staying overnight.\nHere are the dates you have to pay the Venice Access Fee:\nPizza Express is changing its reward scheme from the end of the month.\nThere are some new perks - but some are being taken away.\nHere's what you need to know...\nTier scheme now\nAt the moment, when you join the scheme (it's free) you are given sign-up status and rewarded with a voucher for free dough balls.\nYou then have to collect at least one Pizza Stamp to level up to the Bronze tier, five stamps to enter Silver and 12 to reach Gold.\nYou earn Pizza Stamps when you eat at a Pizza Express restaurant, order for collection or delivery, or buy a selected chilled supermarket pizza.\nTier system from 28 April\nThe sign-up status will be scrapped and you will become a Bronze tier member as soon as you register.\nYou will then reach Silver when you have collected three stamps and Gold when you hit 10.\nRewards changes\nBronze tier\nUnder the Bronze tier, you will be able to claim a free side or free dough balls every time you visit and get 25% off a children's meal.\nOn your birthday, you will also receive a free dessert.\nCurrently, you can only claim the free side and the free birthday dessert.\nSilver tier\nWhile you will still get a free side during every visit under the changes, the offer of a free soft and hot drink is being scrapped.\nInstead, you'll get a free upgrade to a Romana-style pizza Monday to Thursday, a free dip, 50% off a children's meal and 10% off pizza-making parties.\nYou'll still get a free classic pizza on your birthday.\nGold tier\nThis tier is seeing the biggest changes to the rewards on offer.\nWhat do you need to do?\nAll the changes will happen automatically, and you will move to the appropriate tier based on the number of stamps you have.\nBut it's worth noting that you will need to have the updated app by 6 May to keep using your loyalty benefits.\nWithout updating it, you will not be able to access your rewards.\nYou can check the full terms and conditions here.\nA remote island in the Pacific Ocean might be 58 years late to the trend but it has finally installed its first ATMs.\nTuvalu, which has a population of around 10,000, made the giant leap into the digital age by introducing five machines to one of its villages.\nFeleti Teo, the prime minister, unveiled the ATM at the headquarters of the National Bank of Tuvalu, with MPs and local leaders in the audience to watch the reveal.\n\"This is a great achievement not just by the launching of the new banking service but a transformative switch era in Tuvalu that will open doors for economic empowerment of the people,\" he said.\nThe machines currently only work with prepaid cards that residents must collect from the bank first, according to The Guardian.\nBut debit cards are expected to come next, with long-term plans looking an introducing Visa usage for international transactions and online shopping.\nThere aren't many purchases we make in life that can be as important as buying a car, so it really pays to make sure you've made the right choice.\nUsed cars make up the bulk of car sales in the UK every year, with an estimated 7.6 million used cars changing hands during 2024 compared to around 1.9 million new cars joining the road.\nA car's value starts to depreciate as soon as it pulls out of the showroom, so even buying a year-old model could save you hundreds or even thousands of pounds.\nRegardless of your budget, used cars often make a lot of financial sense. In many cases, new cars lose the majority of their value within a few years of being registered, while there are also plenty of low-mileage bargains out there. Dino Buratti, Which? cars expert\nWith this in mind, we're breaking down the various steps it takes to buy a second-hand car and looking at how to make sure you get the best deal.\nWhere to start looking\nYou don't need to trawl through the classified ads any more - you can buy used cars from a trader (a business that sells cars), at an auction or privately - but each comes with its own risks.\nIf buying from a trader, look for an established firm with a good reputation. Having a trade association sign (like the Retail Motor Industry Federation) is helpful.\nAuctions are riskier, and you probably won't have the legal protection that you have if you buy from a trader, like the right to a return or refund. Make sure you read the auction house's terms and conditions of business carefully before making a bid.\nBuying online is also common - eBay is one of the most popular places to buy a car. But remember, if you pay using PayPal, its purchase protection doesn't apply to cars - and neither does eBay's own buyer protection, so you can't turn to either if things go wrong.\nOn the price of the car, if it sounds too good to be true, it likely is, so be wary.\nIf the price is below what similar models are generally going for, it could be a sign that it's a scam or the car has an underlying issue.\nYou've found the car, now what?\nOnce you think you've found the car of your dreams, it's time to do some online checks. Doing simple checks will reduce your chances of buying a car that's being sold illegally or has had major repairs not reported by the seller.\nUse the DVLA's free online vehicle information checker to make sure everything the seller is telling you matches the online records.\nYou should be checking the registration numbers match, as well as the MOT test numbers, mileage on the car and its make and model.\nIt's important you check the MOT and service history too, otherwise the vehicle might not be roadworthy. There's a free government service that allows you to check the MOT history of a car. Make sure you ask the seller about any gaps in a vehicle's MOT record.\nOnce you've reached this stage, it's time to get up close and personal. You should look at the car itself and inspect:\nTaking the car for a thorough test drive is important too - is it a bumpy ride? Does the clutch slip? Does the car pull in one direction?\nHow do I negotiate a better price?\nHaggling isn't just for the Sunday markets, and buying a second-hand car from a dealer it's virtually expected of you to bargain a little.\nYou should start low and let the seller work the price up, and remember to only pay what you can afford.\nLook for things that could throw up costs in the near future - such as a short MOT or worn tyres - and use them as bargaining tools.\nYou might also consider seeing if a discount is available for paying in cash.\nWays to pay\nYou can buy the vehicle on finance, though it can be more expensive this way, and you'll need to make sure you can afford the monthly payments.\nIf you pay cash, you can sometimes receive a discount, but remember if something goes wrong with the car you won't have the same protection some credit arrangements offer.\nIf you use a credit card, you'll get protection for goods between £100 and £30,000, even if you only paid for a small part of the cost on the card.\nIf paying a larger sum, remember that interest rates on credit cards are often much higher than a finance agreement.\nWhat documents should I receive?\nYou must inform the DVLA of the change in a car's registered keeper. The traditional way of doing this is for both parties to sign the car's V5 logbook and post it to the DVLA or go online.\nYou also need an MOT certificate, without which the vehicle cannot be legally driven on the road. Always check the certificate has the same vehicle registration and chassis number as the car you're viewing.\nYou should also ensure you've got all the manuals and the servicing booklet in case things go wrong.\nFinally, it's worth asking the seller to provide a signed receipt that specifies the price and date, as well as the make, model, engine size and registration of the vehicle.\nOther things to remember\nYou should check how much road tax you'll have to pay, and if you can afford the insurance costs on your new car.\nRemember, you need to have car insurance before you take ownership of the car - even if you're not driving it just yet.\nWhat are my rights if things go wrong?\nIf there's a problem with your used car after you buy it, you have legal rights.\nYou might be entitled to a repair, the cost of a repair, or some or all of your money back if the vehicle is damaged, doesn't work, or doesn't match the advert or description you were given.\nYou won't be entitled to anything if:","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nNow that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are live in the U.S., market watchers are looking for the next potentially bullish event to drive cryptocurrency gains. Following the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-awaited decision to approve these financial products, bitcoin ETFs have simultaneously overperformed and underwhelmed expectations – representing the pluses and minuses of a market driven by hype.\nThis is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\nThe top three bitcoin ETFs have seen well over half a billion dollars worth of capital inflows (not counting Grayscale’s $22 billion fund, which was converted over from the existing GBTC trust and has seen sizable outflows), signifying the significant customer demand for traditional on-ramps into bitcoin [BTC]. In the weeks leading up to the date of approval, Wednesday, Jan. 10, bitcoin rallied to a recent high of ~$48,000.\nMany analysts and traders are now hoping the upcoming bitcoin halving — when the rate of new bitcoins issued to network validators (aka miners) is slashed — could be a similar catalyst for crypto prices. There is a longstanding debate whether these programmatically triggered events that occur once every four years are “priced in.”\nThe approval of bitcoin ETF’s last week may give some indication of what’s to come for the next bitcoin hype cycle. The listing of 11 new bitcoin funds was a clear moment to sell, at least in hindsight, and bitcoin has since sagged ~12% to $42,250 today. It remains too early to say whether bitcoin ETFs will draw in billions of new dollars and investors, a prediction that hangs on actual demand for bitcoin.\nSee also: Bitcoin Traders Eye Support at $40K as ETF Contrarian Bets Prove Right\nMeanwhile, the bitcoin halving (sometimes halvening) narrative is a supply-side story: bitcoin’s price could pop after the supply of new coins entering the market becomes constrained, assuming use of the Bitcoin network remains steady or increases.\nTo some extent, the bitcoin halving narrative is a post-hoc rationalization for the fact that bitcoin has in fact gone on a tear in the months after every halving so far. For instance, six months after the network’s second halving in 2016 (when the emissions of new coins per block fell from 25 to 12.5 BTC), bitcoin crossed the $1,000 threshold for the first time. A similar rally happened in 2020, when bitcoin set a new all-time high.\nBut there’s little to suggest that these price increases are directly related to the halving, outside of the increased bullish sentiment and media coverage that typically precedes the event. CoinShares, in its latest “Mining Report” noted that there’s a “peak in hashrate growth often occurs about four months before the halving, likely due to a ‘Bitcoin rush,’” which could represent positive sentiment.\nExcept the economic logic around a bitcoin supply shock is a bit shaky, considering that the supply of new bitcoins will actually continue to increase for the next century or so, at which point all 21 million bitcoins will have been mined. Satoshi Nakamoto designed the Bitcoin network to subsidize miners through these rewards to stimulate adoption, hoping that over time transaction fees will grow large enough to sustain network security and validation.\nCoinShares doesn’t offer a price prediction in its report, which instead makes the case that bitcoin mining will grow more competitive after the halving, knocking out the least efficient miners. While Bitcoin has become 90% more efficient since the last halving, hashrate (which represents the amount of computing power put towards network security) and cost structures have also increased.\nIn fact, the current bitcoin mining difficulty is at historic highs, with computing power jumping over 100% in 2023. CoinShares predicts this to fall off after the halving with a “miner exodus.” The company also said the “average cost of production per coin” could normalize at just under $38,000 post-halving, given the complicated interrelation between hardware and electricity costs, difficulty levels and the cost structures that determine whether certain miners are making or losing money, which determines how many miners are on the network.\nWhat exactly does this mean for bitcoin price predictions? Well somewhat contradictorily, if bitcoin prices remain above $40,000 it may actually drive miner returns lower. CoinShares doesn’t offer this prediction as such, but given that miners are often the largest sellers of bitcoin, reduced profitability may also create selling pressure from that group.\nSee also: Bitcoin Miner Outflows Hit Six-Year Highs Ahead of Halving\nThere are plenty of others who disagree, and see the halving as another potential positive catalyst for bitcoin prices. But it’s important to note that everyone has their own incentives. The only near-guarantee when it comes to the halving is that it’s another moment for hype.",null,"Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThis article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

BTC pulled back to as low as $41,500 early Monday before recovering after briefly hitting its two-year high above $49,000 as the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. started trading last Thursday. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was much anticipated and well priced, so the event will likely be a short- to mid-term top for the price, analysts at Japan-based crypto exchange bitBank told CoinDesk in an email.\nIt’s unclear how much fresh capital the new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) will attract, but significant funds from other crypto products are expected to pour in, J.P. Morgan said in a Thursday research report. The market reaction to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) reluctant approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has been relatively muted, with the focus now shifting to how much capital these new ETFs will pull in, the report said. “We are skeptical of the optimism shared by many market participants at the moment that a lot of fresh capital will enter the crypto space as a result of the spot bitcoin ETF approval,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\nVenezuela is ending its Petro cryptocurrency on Monday, more than five years after it was first launched, according to multiple reports citing a message displayed on the Patria Platform, the only website where the Petro was tradeable. President Nicolas Maduro launched the Petro (PTR) in Feb. 2018 to support the nation’s currency, the bolívar, in the face of an economic crisis exacerbated by U.S. sanctions. The token, backed by the nation’s rich oil reserves, was embroiled in controversy even before the launch. The country’s opposition-controlled congress said it was illegal to borrow against the oil reserves. In 2019, U.S. authorities sanctioned a Russian bank for financing the Petro.\nTokenized Fund Adoption Grows but Brings Technology Risks: Moody's\nIn Failed Bitfinex Exploit Attempt, Billions in XRP Moved\nBitcoin's Technicals Suggests Deeper Pullback to $38K: Analyst","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAccording to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could soar to as high as $1.5 million by 2030. Given Bitcoin's current price of just under $50,000, that would represent a nearly 3,000% gain within a remarkably short period.\nAt first glance, this $1.5 million price target might strike you as outlandish. After all, in its entire 15-year history, Bitcoin has only reached a high of $69,000 -- and that was during the extremely frothy and speculative crypto bull market of 2020-2021. But, as Wood points out, two key catalysts could lead to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value. Let's take a closer look.\nThe obvious starting point is the new spot Bitcoin ETF product. Ark Invest is one of the investment firms that received approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, so it's no surprise that Wood is extremely bullish on what this means for the long-term growth of Bitcoin. As she recently pointed out on CNBC, the SEC just gave the \"green light\" for both Wall Street and Main Street to invest in Bitcoin.\nConsidering that institutional investors have trillions of dollars in assets under management, it won't take a lot to move the needle. For example, if institutional investors such as pension funds and endowment funds decide to allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the ramifications could be enormous. It could result in billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin.\nAt the same time, wealth managers and financial planners could start advising their clients to consider allocating a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. That, too, could lead to an influx of new money flowing into Bitcoin. Most likely, this would occur over a longer period, and probably won't have as dramatic an effect as, say, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) flipping the switch on $10 trillion in assets under management.\nMoreover, Bitcoin has an expanding array of use cases that make it valuable. Remember -- Bitcoin is not just a financial asset, it's also a technological innovation based on blockchain technology. The most obvious use case right now is acting as a store of value. Many crypto investors refer to Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" precisely because it appears to be a long-term store of value, similar to physical gold.\nBut there are a handful of other use cases for Bitcoin that you might not have considered. In Ark Invest's \"Big Ideas 2023\" report, the investment firm lays out eight different use cases for Bitcoin. For each of these use cases, the firm applies several different projections and estimates for just how big the market opportunity might become.\nFor example, the base case scenario in the Ark Invest report is for institutional investors to allocate 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. But the bull case scenario calls for institutional investors to allocate as much as 6.5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The more that institutional investors buy (literally) into the idea of Bitcoin, the higher Bitcoin could go in the medium to long term.\nBased on the above, Bitcoin would seem to be unstoppable. No wonder Cathie Wood recently doubled down on her $1.5 million price estimate for Bitcoin. But just keep in mind that Bitcoin is rarely predictable and often highly volatile. So while the long-term macro trend might be for Bitcoin to soar in value, there is sure to be plenty of turbulence along the way.\nOne of the primary risks to Bitcoin has always been regulatory risk. Simply stated, the SEC could decide to pull the plug on Bitcoin at any moment. The large-scale approval of so many different spot Bitcoin ETF products at one time would appear to signal that the SEC is finally OK with the idea of investors buying Bitcoin. But what if the new ETFs perform erratically, or there are major glitches in how Bitcoin trades in the crypto market as a result of so much new money entering the market so quickly?\nThat being said, I agree with Wood that a \"building block\" model for Bitcoin valuation -- in which all the use case projections for Bitcoin are summed up and then aggregated -- makes a lot of sense. And I agree that spot Bitcoin ETF approval is almost certain to lead to billions of new dollars flowing into Bitcoin. The big question, though, is just how long it will take Bitcoin to reach that mythical $1 million price target.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

Elsewhere, analysts at 10x Research, led by Markus Thielen, said in a Monday note that they expected prices to find support at as low as $38,000.\nMeanwhile, FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a Monday email that a correction to at least $40,000 per bitcoin would be “within bounds of typical corrections,” given the cryptocurrency’s price performance of over 150% over 2023.\nAs such, long-term expectations for bitcoin remain largely bullish, given the apparent demand for ETFs, as volumes indicate, among institutional players.\n“Bitcoin ETFs will be transformative for the industry, allowing for vastly greater access from traditional wealth management - their launch will bring new investment into bitcoin from pensions, endowments, insurance companies, sovereign wealth, retirement plans, trusts, and many more,” shared Henry Robinson, founder at crypto fund Decimal Digital Group, in an email to CoinDesk.\n“However, while the ETF launches are exciting, we think they offer no advantage over self-custody. For long-term holders, the fee emissions will bleed a position substantially. It may take many years, but we expect demand for ETFs to dwindle as bitcoin adoption rises and self-custody becomes more common among institutions,” Robinson added."]}

But, some cryptocurrency investors think the Bitcoin price is going to more than double again in 2024 to US$100,000 following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite that, I'd prefer to invest in S&P\/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) shares.\nReporting by CNBC suggested that growing acceptance of Bitcoin could mean the cryptocurrency becomes more 'mainstream' and may lead to stronger demand.\nAnthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said to the CNBC:\nI think this is a really big breakthrough for bitcoin as a digital asset, it's a much broader story for digital property in general.\nCould bitcoin be $100,000, which is more or a little bit more than a double over the next year? I do believe that.\nI have been wrong so many times before.\nOf course, a prediction doesn't make something true, it's just a guess from someone who wants to see the value rise.\nEveryone is entitled is invest in whichever asset class they want to – bonds, property, shares, cryptocurrency, commodities and so on.\nMy preferred choice is individual (ASX 200) shares for a few different reasons.\nI like that many of them are making a profit and can reinvest that profit into making more profit – that's the power of compounding.\nWith some of that profit, ASX 200 shares can decide to pay dividends. This creates passive income without having to sell any of the shares.\nAt some point over the next year or two, I think it's quite likely that interest rates are going to be cut, which could be good news for the valuation of ASX 200 shares.\nThere are a number of businesses on the ASX that have strong economic moats, or competitive advantages, which could allow them to continue to deliver good returns for many years into the future and protect the business against competition.\nASX 200 shares also have the option of diversifying its operations by launching a new service or product related to its core offering or starting\/acquiring a whole new division. For example, Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES) recently moved into healthcare, yet its main focus is retailing.\nSome of the ASX 200 shares I've bought in the last few months and can see myself buying more of include Lovisa Holding Ltd (ASX: LOV), Pinnacle Investment Management Group Ltd (ASX: PNI) and Johns Lyng Group Ltd (ASX: JLG).\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nMacquarie is bullish about these three financial stocks.\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nIs this stock now a bargain after the market volatility?\nRead more »\nApril 14, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nThese businesses could make smart buying today.\nRead more »\nApril 14, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nThese stocks could be beneficiaries from the latest announcements to help first home buyers.\nRead more »\nApril 14, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nThis stock has a lot of positives, in my view.\nRead more »\nApril 14, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nI’m optimistic about the future of this company.\nRead more »\nApril 14, 2025 |\n        Tristan Harrison\nThis dividend-paying stock could please income-seeking investors.\nRead more »\nApril 11, 2025 |\n        Sebastian Bowen\nDemand for precious metals could go higher from here.\nRead more »\nNotifications\nScott Phillips just released his 5 best stocks to buy right now and you could grab the names of these stocks instantly!"]}

Some information may no longer be current.\nA new batch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has attracted strong investor interest, though it is unclear if they will be able to maintain the pace of inflows in coming weeks.\nInvestors have poured US$1.9-billion into nine new exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of bitcoin in their first three days of trading, data from issuers and analysts showed, with fund giants BlackRock and Fidelity pulling in the lion’s share of the flows.\nCollective flows to the nine funds outpaced postlaunch flows into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO-A), which drew a record US$1.2-billion in the first three days of trading after its 2021 launch. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD-A) attracted US$1.13-billion in the first three days after its 2004 launch.\nStill, the investments in the long-awaited ETFs – launched on Jan. 11, a day after receiving approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – fell short of the most aggressive estimates of first-day flows in the billions of dollars.\nMarket participants said it remained to be seen to what degree funds tracking the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency continue drawing retail and institutional investors, and which issuers will come out ahead. Some bullish analysts have said flows could reach between US$50-billion and US$100-billion by the end of the year.\nBitcoin is down more than 8 per cent since Jan. 11, after rallying in recent months on anticipation that the ETFs would finally get the nod from the SEC.\n“So far, the launches have almost measured up to the hype,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF analyst at Strategas. “The next question is: What is their staying power? What will those flows look like in six months’ time, or six years from now?”\nFor now, lower fees and name recognition appear to be key factors in drawing investors. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT-Q) from asset management giant BlackRock has attracted more than US$700-million, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC-A) has topped US$500-million, according to BitMEX Research, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.\nFees among the nine issuers – before waivers – range from a low of 0.19 per cent to a high of 0.39 per cent.\nBlackRock is charging a fee of 0.12 per cent for the first US$5-billion in assets and the first 12 months of trading. After that, the fee will rise to 0.25 per cent. Fidelity is initially charging zero, rising to 0.25 per cent after July 31. Those fees will still be less than half the average ETF fee of 0.54 per cent, as calculated by Morningstar Inc.\n“Fees are clearly a key determinant for success,” said Sui Chung, chief executive officer of CF Benchmarks, which is providing the index against which six of the new ETFs will be measured.\n“Those that charge the lower management fees will unsurprisingly make themselves more appealing compared to their peers. Brand recognition is another core aspect.”\nWhile BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated inflows, other issuers with a strong brand among cryptocurrency aficionados aren’t that far behind.\nBoth Bitwise and a joint venture of Ark Investments and 21Shares are initially waiving fees. Bitwise said its inflows in the first three days totaled US$305.5-million, while the Ark\/21Shares ETF has had inflows of nearly US$230-million, according to BitMEX.\nBy contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with a fee of 1.5 per cent, has seen outflows this month. The trust was converted into an ETF at the same time the other ETFs were launched, and has seen US$1.16-billion in outflows in its first three trading days, data from BitMEX showed.\nPaul Karger, founder of Twin Focus, a boutique wealth management advisory firm, says some of his clients are selling their GBTC holdings and moving into the cheaper new ETFs.\n“We’re seeing a shift from GBTC to the new, lower-cost ETFs, as well as some clients putting more money to work in the cheaper options” from brand-name issuers, he said.\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein pointed out that unlike the newly launched products, Grayscale already had substantial assets at the time of its conversion, allowing investors to lock in profits after Bitcoin’s run. The firm’s fees, meanwhile, “reflect a certain value that it brings to the market and to investors,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nGrayscale “has a 10-year track record. It has 20-some-odd billion dollars of AUM (assets under management), a diversified shareholder base, tight spreads, and unbelievable liquidity,” Mr. Sonnenshein said.\nThe next hurdle for the funds will likely be demonstrating their ability to win acceptance among institutional investors, such as pension funds, and investment advisers.\n“The question of what to do with these in a portfolio has been drowned out by a lot of the noise” surrounding the new products’ debut, Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, said ahead of last week’s launch of its ETF. Galaxy has partnered with Invesco to launch the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF , one of the nine new spot bitcoin ETFs.\nThe process of talking about what kind of allocation is appropriate and how spot bitcoin ETFs will “work their way into model portfolios will come into focus in the next six months,” he said.\nBe smart with your money.

However, Bitcoin's pricing — and the wider crypto market — has experienced extreme volatility over the last year, with periods of pricing declines and upticks that have been hard to predict.\nAnd, the crypto asset experienced yet another significant correction this week when the price of Bitcoin dropped to $40,000 — a decline of approximately 12% and the lowest price point since December 18, 2023. This price drop occurred shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to commence trading on January 10.\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a move that had initially been expected to bolster the cryptocurrency's value — but instead triggered a correction that sent shockwaves through the market. And, that plunge in Bitcoin's price has left investors grappling with uncertainties. In turn, some investors may be reevaluating their strategies, considering alternative assets — like gold — that may provide a more stable haven instead. But is gold actually a good alternative to Bitcoin? Let's find out.\nReady to get started? Find your top gold investing options here.\nWith the price of Bitcoin falling, it could make sense to consider investing in gold instead — and there are a few good reasons why, including:\nGold has long been considered a safe-haven asset, meaning that it can help to protect your wealth during periods of market or economic turbulence. And, unlike Bitcoin, which is a relatively new entrant in the financial landscape, gold has historically weathered a number of economic storms.\nThat's a large part of why investors have traditionally turned to gold during times of crisis. They view it as a store of value that retains its worth even in the face of market fluctuations. And, with the price of Bitcoin fluctuating right now, it may be a good time to consider adding gold to your portfolio to help offset some of the potential losses from your crypto investments.\nLearn more about how you can invest in gold today.\nGold has long exhibited an inverse relationship with traditional equities, often acting as a counterbalance to stock market movements. When stocks experience volatility or decline, gold has historically seen increased demand by investors.\nThis inverse correlation can be an attractive feature for investors seeking diversification in their portfolios, especially during times when the broader market is facing challenges. And, if your portfolio includes a large amount of Bitcoin, this could be the right time to take advantage of gold's ability to move inversely to Bitcoin and many other investment assets.\nWhile the inflation rate has been tempered compared to what it was this time last year, the most recent inflation report showed that we may not be done just yet. Inflation ticked back up unexpectedly in December and is still hovering above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% and it's unclear what may happen in the future.\nBut while the timeline for resolving the inflation issues may be up in the air, what's clear is that gold has historically proven to be an effective hedge against rising prices due to inflation. The precious metal has historically maintained its purchasing power amid high inflation, making it an attractive option for investors who are concerned about the eroding effects of inflation on their portfolios.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which exists purely in digital form, gold is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. Physical gold, whether in the form of gold bullion — like gold bars and coins — or jewelry, provides investors with a tangible asset they can hold. This tangible appeal can offer a sense of security and ownership that digital assets, like crypto, may lack.\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties that are occurring across the globe can also contribute to increased demand for gold. In times of crisis or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as safer, and gold tends to be a primary beneficiary of such sentiment. So, given the current geopolitical climate, it could be a smart time to invest in gold — especially as Bitcoin's value drops.\nAs Bitcoin faces a period of correction following the SEC's approval of ETFs, investors may find themselves at a crossroads, evaluating the resilience of their portfolios. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities to investors, the recent market downturn also prompts a reconsideration of traditional safe-haven assets. And gold, with its historical stability, inverse relationship with equities, inflation-hedging qualities, tangible appeal and ability to thrive in times of global economic uncertainty, emerges as a compelling option.\nThat said, investors who are interested in gold investing should carefully assess their risk tolerance, investment goals and overall portfolio diversification strategy before making any decisions. While Bitcoin and gold represent distinct asset classes with different risk profiles, the current market conditions emphasize the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment approach. And, in times of uncertainty, having a mix of assets that respond differently to market dynamics can help safeguard investors against the inherent volatility of financial markets.\nAngelica Leicht is the senior editor for the Managing Your Money section for CBSNews.com, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

In the months leading up to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission giving the green light to begin trading, investors bought bitcoin in anticipation of the approval.\n\"Today's bitcoin move is wholly expected,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. \"It looks like a 'sell-the-news' pullback, before we see the cryptocurrency recapturing its bullish trajectory.\"\nBitcoin has fallen 14% since Jan. 10, the day the SEC gave its approval. Ether, which has been outperforming bitcoin, is still up 3% during the same period.\nCharts analysts have warned that although its long-term uptrend remains intact, it likely still has further to fall. On Monday morning, Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that bitcoin could dip to as low as $36,000, adding that it wouldn't be there for long. Wolfe's Rob Ginsberg said it could be just the beginning of a disappointing first quarter of the year.\nCryptocurrencies broadly saw big declines Monday. Solana's sol token lost 7%, while Ripple's XRP fell 4% and the token tied to the DeFi protocol Uniswap dropped 5%.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:","This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\nThe extravagantly hyped launch of some of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US proved to be the nth iteration of the famous market-based adage: buy the rumor and sell the news. In fact, we had highlighted the utility of moving toward Ethereum in an auxiliary post at the time. Now, as Bitcoin seems poised to lose the $40,000 price level, some crypto bigwigs believe that the ongoing bout of weakness will last till the end of January 2024.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the apex cryptocurrency had made a run toward the $49,000 price level. However, since then, Bitcoin has been firmly glued to the downward escalator. Many theories emerged to explain this confounding weakness. Some pointed to the veritable flood of redemptions emanating from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) spot ETF now that its unit holders are no longer bogged down by the trust's outflow barriers. Others laid the blame squarely on South Korean and Asian traders, who've been buying up BTC aggressively over the past few months in anticipation of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and might now have dabbled in some profit-taking activity. Of these, the former appears more plausible.\nBitcoin Spot ETF Flow data - Day 6\nGBTC share count out for day 6th (19th Jan). It implies $590m of outflow. Total GBTC outflow $2.8 billion\nBitwise data also out for day 6, strong day from Bitwise at +$56m pic.twitter.com\/3zqiGHZazg\n— BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) January 20, 2024\nConsider the fact that total outflows from GBTC have now reached $2.8 billion.\nAs per the tabulation by Arkham Intelligence, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF continues to face mounting redemption requests.\nBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayer said that Bitcoin will fall below $40,000 and has bought some some 29Mar $35k strike puts. He also predicted that Bitcoin’s decline will continue until the 31Jan US Treasury qtly refunding annc. Arthur Hayer may have purchased put options at a price… pic.twitter.com\/gzuQhp3xWq\n— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 22, 2024\nAgainst this backdrop, BitMEX's co-founder, Arthur Hayes, has now postulated that Bitcoin will likely fall below the $40,000 price level and that the ongoing correction will persist through January. Hayes believes that Bitcoin will remain under pressure until the US Treasury's quarterly funding announcement, currently scheduled for the 31st of January.\n🔸 FTX Sold About $1B of Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF, Explaining Much of Outflow: Sources\nBTC's price has fallen since bitcoin ETFs were approved. In theory, now that FTX is done selling its substantial holdings, the selling pressure could ease since a bankruptcy estate liquidating…\n— *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 22, 2024\nMeanwhile, it appears that FTX had something to do with the persistent outflows from GBTC, with the estate of the defunct crypto exchange purportedly responsible for redemptions of around 22 million units, equating to roughly $1 billion in outflows. Do note that FTX seems to have liquidated the entirety of its GBTC holdings. Consequently, with this persistent source of outflows now exhausted, Bitcoin enthusiasts can finally prepare for the upward thrust that is quite likely to materialize in the runup to the cryptocurrency's next halving event in April 2024, when the reward for mining Bitcoin will again be cut in half in what is a regular 4-year cycle.","Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts.\nHello, and welcome back to Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.\nThis is our Monday show, in which we look back at the weekend and the week ahead.

The token was trading at $39,300 at midday Tuesday, climbing slightly from lows earlier in the day.\nThe latest decline wipes the gains from a strong rally that kicked off at the end of last year. From October to January 11, the day after regulators gave the green light for the new products, bitcoin surged 70% to $46,000.\n\"It's classic 'buy the rumor, sell the news,'\" Tuttle Capital Management chief executive Matthew Tuttle told Business Insider. \"A couple weeks back, everyone pretty much knew the ETFs would get approved, and you saw bitcoin's price ramp up. People bought it up in anticipation, then took their profits.\"\nTo that point, over recent months, the overwhelming sentiment among market strategists on bitcoin has been bullish. The ETFs usher in more mainstream acceptance and allow for a wider share of investors to gain exposure to crypto without buying a token outright.\nFundstrat's Tom Lee, for one, forecasted earlier this month that the spot ETFs could help bitcoin jump to $500,000 over five years. Standard Chartered analysts said it could top $200,000 within two years. While those predictions still have a long time to pan out, the showing in the wake of the SEC's approval has been decidedly weak.\nFairlead Strategies founder and managing partner Katie Stockton told Business Insider that the recent short-term breakdown for bitcoin doesn't mean it isn't a good investment over the intermediate- to long-term. The sell-off, she explained, comes at a natural place on the price chart, as it followed a strong move higher.\n\"The pullback shouldn't be instilling any massive panic,\" Stockton said. \"It does not appear to be a bearish reversal to us.\"\nEven though the market anticipated the approval of the products, Fairlead expects bitcoin to trend higher, and Stockton said longer-term indicators suggest momentum remains intact.\n\"Maybe the rally got extended on the [spot bitcoin] news, but I do think it's positive for bitcoin and crypto,\" she said. \"It enhances the ability for people to invest, and with that comes more institutional relevance.\"\nTuttle also remains optimistic despite the latest dip. He said if he had to pick whether to go long or short on bitcoin, he would choose the former.\n\"Client interest in bitcoin ETFs has increased,\" Tuttle said. \"And I think demand for those will drive demand for the cryptocurrency.\"\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges",null]}

You're much better off being an index investor.\"\nMalkiel is the chief investment officer of investment platform Wealthfront, a professor emeritus of economics at Princeton University, and the author of \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\" He spoke ahead of publishing a letter to Wealthfront investors on Thursday that trumpeted the power of dollar-cost averaging, low-cost index funds, portfolio diversification and rebalancing, risk management, and tax-loss harvesting for everyday people.\nWarren Buffett and Jack Bogle, who Malkiel hailed as \"two of my heroes,\" have offered similar advice. The legendary stock picker has said that almost everyone should steadily invest in a S&P 500 tracker fund over the course of decades. Meanwhile, Vanguard's founder has underscored the danger of fees by saying that \"in investing, you get what you don't pay for.\"\nBack in 2020, Malkiel rang the alarm on the day-trading boom as the antithesis of that approach. In the interview this week, he called out the same kind of mindless speculation on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\"Absolutely that still is in my view a real danger,\" he said. \"Most people are going to lose their shirts.\"\nMalkiel singled out bitcoin as especially worrisome, given its volatility and lack of utility.\n\"This is not a useful currency, its only uses are to hide things from the government and for ransomware,\" Malkiel said. \"I don't want to go in and buy my Starbucks coffee in the morning with bitcoin which might be worth $45,000 one day and $40,000 the next.\"\nThe former Vanguard director, dean of Yale's management school, and White House economic advisor also weighed in on the stock market.\n\"There's no question about the fact that valuations are high,\" he said, although he noted that price-to-earnings multiples on the hottest technology stocks are still a fraction as high as during the dot-com bubble.\nStill, he warned that lofty prices would likely weigh on portfolio performance.\n\"When valuations are above average, long-run returns are going to be somewhat lower\" than their roughly 10% annual average over the last century, he said. \"There's probably somewhat greater optimism about returns than there should be. People ought to be very modest in their expectations.\"\nAs for the economy, Malkiel emphasized the futility of trying to call the next downturn.\n\"Not only do I think you can't predict the stock market, but neither the market, the Fed board of governors, or economists can tell you if we're gonna have the recession,\" he said. \"I don't have any idea, and neither does anybody else.\"\nMalkiel concluded by reiterating the core message of his letter: \"Regular saving, even for people of very modest means, can get you a wonderful retirement portfolio,\" he said. \"The American dream is not over.\"\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}
