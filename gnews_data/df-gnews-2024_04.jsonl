However, PeepalCo also claimed that the expansion was always on the cards.\nLemonn will target “an under-represented asset class of retail equity investors in India”, said Ashish Singhal, co-founder and chief executive of CoinSwitch, a cryptocurrency unicorn with 20 million registered users.\n“We’re looking to find our market fit by offering what competitors do not have. This will include a curated view of every stock based on sell-side analyst outtakes, and industry-based curation of companies that will help investors discover lesser-known stocks across sectors, and to make more informed investment decisions.”\nHowever, the Lemonn brand, registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) under Nu Investors Technologies, will not need to acquire a market advisory license to offer its services, Singhal said.\n“This is a field that we may pursue in the months to come, and the idea remains open. For now, we’re not into management and advisory, since we’re only showcasing ratings that analysts have already published, and not offering our own advisory.”\nWhile Singhal refrained from providing a target for the first year of operations, the equity trading platform is expected to revive the company's fortunes.\nIn FY23, PeepalCo reported around 82% decline in its net revenue from  ₹248.6 crore a year ago to  ₹45.6 crore. In comparison, India’s largest brokerage firm in terms of active client volumes, Zerodha’s operating revenue in FY23 was at  ₹6,875 crore, while net profit stood at  ₹2,909 crore. Zerodha had over 6.5 million daily active users at the end of 2023.\n“The drop in revenue was largely due to prioritizing compliance, because of which retail deposits and withdrawals in crypto trading were suspended until December last year.\"\n\"With the new trading platform becoming operational, we will see some boost coming through to our revenue, although right now the priority will be on finding the right market fit and acquiring users,” he added.\nDevam Sardana, business head, Lemonn, said the equity and crypto platforms will operate independently, with no cross-sharing of user data or operational overlap. “We also have a 100-member team just for the equity platform, which we plan to scale up by the end of this year.”\nLemonn, signifying “a fresh approach to equity investments”, will also compete with the likes of Upstox, Groww, Angel One, and ICICI Direct, besides Zerodha.\nAccording to BSE data, as of Tuesday, India has 167.6 million registered equity investors, representing just over 11.5% of the population. CoinSwitch aims to capitalize on the opportunities offered by this under-penetrated sector.\nSince the introduction of a 30% long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on all profits from crypto withdrawals, and 1% tax deducted at source for all crypto trades on exchanges in the Union Budget for FY22, domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have witnessed a significant decline in daily average trading volumes.\nAccording to data from market tracker Crebaco Global, daily average trading volumes across three leading domestic exchanges—WazirX, CoinDCX, and Zebpay— declined by 90% from $68.5 million in March 2022 just $6.7 million on 29 February. However, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high in March.\nBesides, the suspension of bank deposits to crypto exchanges for retail users, and the bearish stance of the Reserve Bank, has severely impacted the crypto industry. However, CoinSwitch asserted that it maintains sufficient cash reserves.\n“We have been careful with our expenses in the past two years, and have a runway of over five years at the moment to innovate for the future,” Singhal said. In October 2021, the company secured a $260 million Series-C funding led by US-based VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), marking the largest venture capital investment in India's crypto industry.\nA senior industry executive, requesting anonymity, said the launch of the trading platform by CoinSwitch was along expected lines, and the company could diversify its product offerings further.\n“It would not be entirely surprising if Singhal decides to exit the crypto market in another five years. The biggest detrimental factor in India is not just the lack of regulations, but taxation. The Centre has no real reason to relax this avenue, since Bitcoin or any other token has not done much to cement investor confidence, despite the one-off exchange-traded fund (ETF) introduction in the US. On overall terms, it seems to be a wise move from a company that is well-funded, and has a sizeable user base,” the executive added.\nSinghal said Lemonn will be promoted on CoinSwitch's crypto platforms to attract users.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The price of Bitcoin is already up 128% in the last year, and about 53% year to date as of writing. However, the price of Bitcoin has come down from 52-week highs; it is currently down 10% since those highs.\nSo, what’s been fuelling this rally in the cryptocurrency? And what should investors consider before jumping in? Here’s why everyone is talking about Bitcoin again.\nFirst, there was the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While cryptocurrency ETFs were already approved in Canada, the approval in the United States was a huge move. These ETFs directly hold Bitcoin and allow institutional investors to participate. This area has been previously hesitant due to regulatory concerns or lack of infrastructure in the past.\nThe influx of institutional money into Bitcoin increased the demand for the cryptocurrency and drove up the price in the process. Furthermore, ETFs provide a convenient way for retail investors to get exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly buy and store cryptocurrency themselves. This, of course, further increased the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the process.\nThere has been speculative interest in Bitcoin as well. This comes from the potential for high returns. The recent economic uncertainty that comes with inflation or volatility in traditional markets has caused investors to seek alternative assets, like Bitcoin, as a hedge. Investors often look for these types of assets that store value and have the potential for significant appreciation. And Bitcoin, as it has a limited supply and decentralized nature, is attractive in this light.\nWhile this might be interesting now, it could change in the future. Institutional adoption could continue, and more ETFs and other investment vehicles could introduce more access to Bitcoin easily. This could fuel further demand and drive up the price.\nRegulatory changes of clearer guidelines could provide more certainty, leading to more retail and institutional investors as well. However, this could also be the opposite, as less clear guidelines and increased scrutiny could cause the price to drop.\nOther changes might include the change in the market and economic futures. Since Bitcoin is being used as a hedge, as the market and volatile economy improve, investors could get out and put money elsewhere. Bitcoin overall is seen as volatile, so share price corrections aren’t exactly uncommon. Therefore, it might be best to look at investing in companies that invest in Bitcoin and other areas.\nInstead of just investing in Bitcoin, even through an ETF, it might be good to invest in companies that also invest in technological advancement. For instance, there are companies investing in the storage of Bitcoin as well as data in general.\nOne company is Hut 8 (TSX:HUT). Hut stock used to mine for cryptocurrency, and that was it. However, it’s since expanded into data storage. It’s been growing both from the increase in Bitcoin prices as well as the increase in its data centre use.\nThe company recently reported substantial growth in earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. However, this was only from the last six months of 2023. Even more growth has come in 2024. And that should continue to be the case in 2024, as Bitcoin increases, and its data centres earn more clients.\nApril 18, 2025 |\n        Christopher Liew, CFA\nYou can get the best deal by investing $1,000 in the TSX’s next high-growth stock today.\nRead more »\nApril 17, 2025 |\n        Amy Legate-Wolfe\nThis Canadian stock may not be the first you think of when hearing \"AI stock,\" but it should be.\nRead more »\nApril 16, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nShopify and Magellan are two top TSX stocks you can buy right now and generate outsized gains in the upcoming…\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Joey Frenette\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands out as a top Mag Seven stock for Canadian investors to buy amid tariff fears.\nRead more »\nApril 15, 2025 |\n        Aditya Raghunath\nBlackBerry is a TSX tech stock that is positioned to underperform the broader markets in the near term.

The index had dropped 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 also fell 1% on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq was down 1.5%.\nThe crypto market was also bleeding Tuesday, with Bitcoin dropping below $65,000.\nHere’s what else is happening in the markets before midday.\nOil prices reached their highest level since October amid tensions in the Middle East and a Ukrainian drone strike on a major Russian oil refinery.\nBrent crude, the world’s oil benchmark, jumped as much as 1.8% to $89 per barrel, the highest since September. And West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also climbed 1.8%, reaching a five-month high of $85 per barrel.\nAmong the worst stock performers Tuesday morning were  health insurance companies, including Humana, CVS Health, UnitedHealth, and Elevance Health. They took a hit after federal regulators didn’t raise payments for Medicare plans above industry expectations.\nHumana stock fell 14%, CVS Health dropped 8.5%, and UnitedHealth dipped 6.8%.\nTesla on Tuesday said it delivered 386,810 electric vehicles over the first three months of 2024, falling wildly short of Wall Street’s expectations.\nTesla stock dropped almost 6% in Tuesday morning trading after the company announced its poor first-quarter deliveries. Shares have fallen more than 33% so far this year, making Tesla the worst performer in the S&P 500. The company is also no longer one of the top 10 U.S. companies by market capitalization, trailing behind Visa, JPMorgan Chase, and weight-loss drug maker Novo Nordisk.\nThe 10-year yield, which determines mortgage and credit card rates, rose to 4.386% Tuesday, surpassing February’s high of 4.352%. That’s the highest level so far this year.\nThe robust performance of the manufacturing sector and the hope for interest rate cuts might have contributed to the rise.\n-William Gavin and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",null,"In this article\nBitcoin fell for a second day to start the new month and quarter amid rising Treasury yields and strength in the U.S. dollar.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency fell more than 4.76% on Tuesday to $66,134.00, bringing its two-day loss to 7%, according to Coin Metrics. At one point it fell as low as $64,572.00.\nOn Monday morning, it was trading at about $70,000 before data came out showing growth in the manufacturing sector for the first time since September 2022 and investor bets on June rate cuts began to cool. Bitcoin is now off its all-time high, reached on March 14, by about 11%.\nEther went down with it, losing 5.6% to trade at $3,240.27.\nMeanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest level of the year and the dollar, which has an inverse relationship with bitcoin, hit a five-month high.\n\"Bitcoin doesn't need much excuse to go through a period of correction after such an explosive performance in Q1,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group. \"Having said that, U.S. economic data has been stronger of late, all while inflation continues to be a concern. This has resulted in a repricing of Fed expectations, translating to broad-based U.S. dollar demand on the more attractive U.S. dollar yield differentials.\"\nBitcoin's move may have been exacerbated by a large bitcoin holder, or \"whale,\" who transferred more than 4,000 bitcoin to the Bitfinex exchange late Monday night. Data from CryptoQuant shows a spike in that exchange's reserves — which typically signals a boost in selling activity — that coincides with the sudden drop in bitcoin price late Monday night.\nStocks tied to the performance of bitcoin were dragged down but traded off their lows to end the day. Crypto exchange Coinbase fell 2%, while software provider MicroStrategy, which largely trades as a proxy for the price of bitcoin, lost 3%. The largest mining stocks, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, lost 8% and 7%, respectively. CleanSpark, one of the best-performing miners this year, slid 9%.\nApril could be tumultuous for crypto and related stocks, particularly mining stocks. Investors are looking toward the bitcoin halving, which will slash the reward, and therefore revenue, of bitcoin miners, in the second half of the month. The event could hurt the performance of miners but historically has set bitcoin up for rallies of 300% or more in the months that follow.\nBitcoin is still up 55% for 2024."]}

Nigerian authorities have asked a local court to prosecute Binance and two of its executives for alleged money laundering and tax evasion. The request was made on Thursday at the high court in the capital of Abuja where one of the executives, Gambaryan, was produced in court while the second remains at large after recently fleeing custody. (AP Photo\/Olamikan Gbemiga )\nABUJA – Nigerian authorities asked in court Thursday for cryptocurrency exchange Binance and two of its executives to be tried for alleged money laundering and tax evasion, the first legal step following weeks of a criminal investigation into the trading platform.\nOnly Tigran Gambaryan, an American citizen and Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, attended the court hearing as Nadeem Anjarwalla, the company’s regional manager remains at large after fleeing custody in late March.\nRecommended Videos\nNigeria harbors Africa’s largest crypto economy in terms of trade volume with many citizens using crypto to hedge their finances against surging inflation and the declining local currency. Authorities, however, alleged the platform was being used for money laundering and terrorism financing.\nIn separate charges seen by The Associated Press Thursday at the Federal High Court in the capital, Abuja, Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency and the local tax authority accused Binance and the two officials of operating without the required license, unlawfully negotiating foreign exchange rates, tax evasion and concealing the origin of illegal proceeds and revenue of $35.4 million.\nGambaryan was escorted in and out of the court by officials from the anti-corruption agency.\nBinance couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.\nSince Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were arrested on Feb.26, their trial has been shrouded with controversy after they accused authorities of illegally detaining them and seizing their passports.\nIn addition, local media had reported that the Nigerian government demanded the names of citizens trading on the platform.\nThe Abuja court on Thursday adjourned the formal commencement of the money laundering trial till April 8 after Mark Mordi, Gambaryan’s lawyer, argued that his client could not represent Binance in the case without the company’s permission, which the public prosecutor disagreed with.\n“There is proof that the second defendant (Gambaryan) is a representative of the first defendant in this country (Binance),” Ekene Iheanacho, a lawyer representing Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Some information may no longer be current.\nConsumers are becoming slightly less skeptical about bitcoin, a Deutsche Bank survey published on Monday showed, although just under a third of those questioned still expect its price to drop sharply by the end of 2024.\nAlthough people have poured billions of dollars into bitcoin, hoping for returns if its price rises, top regulators have said it has no inherent value and presents risks.\nDeutsche Bank said it surveyed more than 3,600 consumers, with 52% of respondents saying cryptocurrencies will be an “important asset class and method of payment transactions” in future. Less than 40% said that when surveyed in September 2023.\nA third of U.S. respondents expect bitcoin to drop below $20,000 by the end of 2024. This group is getting slightly smaller. It was 35% in February and 36% in January.\nThe number of people who think cryptocurrencies are “just a fad that will eventually fade” dropped to less than 1%.\nStill, only 10% of respondents expect bitcoin to be above $75,000 by year-end.\nBitcoin hit a three-week high on Monday. It reached an all-time high of $73,794 in March, recovering from a dramatic plunge in 2022.\nThe recent revival is due to excitement about spot bitcoin ETFs and expectations of rate cuts, analysts say.\nSome analysts see bitcoin’s recent recovery above $70,000 as a sign that investors are shrugging off the warnings.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said expect bitcoin’s price to be supported by the upcoming “bitcoin halving”, as well as by regulation, central bank rate cuts, and expectations that the SEC will approve spot ethereum ETFs.\nBe smart with your money.

Its rise has proliferated into other digital assets, with many investors in this space focusing on cryptos alone.\nSo, within this sector, two key catalysts could drive greater upside over the near-term. They both have to do with Bitcoin. First is the upcoming halving event, set to take place in a couple weeks. And the second is the impact spot ETFs will have on the entire sector.\nAs more money flows into this space, and Bitcoin’s price rises following its halving, other related companies should benefit. Some publicly-traded companies do well when crypto does well. Much focus now is shifted to spot Bitcoin ETFs (which can be bought and sold on the markets just as stocks are). However, a valuation gap may be coming into play.\nTherefore, let’s dive into three crypto stocks to benefit most from a possible vicious rally higher for the rest of the year.\nShowing up as the top blockchain stock worldwide, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a top option for equity investors. It provides the critical infrastructure to support the largest centralized exchange in the U.S.\nDespite legal and regulatory challenges, Coinbase is still the top player in its industry. As such, when the SEC did approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase took over handling the back-end functionality for most of the companies that successfully received approvals from regulators.\nNotably, analysts have been upgrading the stock in recent weeks. Kyle Voigt, an analyst from KBW, expressed their impressions on COIN as it has showed unique exposure in the crypto economy. This analyst raised his price target to $230 from $160, while maintaining a market performance rating, noting potential revenue growth from increased USD Coin balances and rising crypto asset levels. Currently, COIN stock trades around $250 per share, so there’s still downside baked into this target. But it’s a significant raise, nonetheless.\nIn the first quarter, outstanding USDC balances surged by 32%, per reports. USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle and backed by Coinbase, contributes to the crypto exchange’s gross interest income, generating about 56% of this key metric. Additionally, March saw a spike in average daily trading volume to $5.1 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in February, driving momentum for the stock.\nIf more capital continues to flow into the crypto sector, it’s likely to come through Coinbase, at least in the U.S. Accordingly, the thesis is very simple with this crypto stock.\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is among the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, making it deserving of a spot on this list.\nRecent bearish sentiment around the upcoming Bitcoin halving has led to selling pressure for MARA stock. That makes sense, since the company’s revenue (at least in terms of Bitcoin mined) will halve overnight.\nBut for those bullish on Bitcoin’s price rising materially following its halving, this is a stock to consider. Recent innovations like MARAFW firmware and MARA UCB 2100 control board aim to optimize mining rigs, enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, the company’s MARA 2PIC700 cooling system promises higher power density. So this will enable robust expansion despite the halving’s impact.\nAlso, Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin production and revenue demonstrate the pivotal role of mining output in its performance assessment. With expanded operations and hash rate, MARA should benefit from rising Bitcoin prices over time. Of course, a Bitcoin price at least 50% above current levels will likely be needed to spark another major rally in this miner. But for those who think that’s possible, buying now may be a decent strategy.\nDuring this year’s crypto surge, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, saw its market cap surpass that of almost half the S&P 500 companies. MicroStrategy’s stock surged 204% in 2024, reaching $1,919 by Wednesday’s close. Contrast this to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 82% year-to-date (YTD) increase.\nHaving initially invested in Bitcoin as an inflation safeguard in August 2020, MicroStrategy continuously accumulated Bitcoin. Today, the company holds a total of 214,246 BTC, becoming the leading corporate holder of this digital asset. While opinions vary on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, it remains a notable aspect of its operations.\nMicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average of $33,706 per Bitcoin. Now, they are valued at $65,000 each. This greatly influences its trajectory. With Bitcoin holdings valued at around $14 billion, this business now vastly overshadows MicroStrategy’s business intelligence segment, providing significant leverage for the future. Predictions of Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 by next year underscore its enduring value.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

The most popular crypto token traded around $70,600, rising 4.5 per cent in the past 24 hours.\nMeanwhile, ethereum rose 3.4 per cent to trade at $3,552, Binance Coin rose 4.5 per cent to trade at $604, Solana spiked 6.26 per cent to trade at $174 and Dogecoin spiked 6.76 per cent to trade at $0.195, according to the CoinDesk data.\nAt the same time, Grayscale’s bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) shows nearly $18 million outflows on Wednesday, a record low since going live in January.\nIt is expected that bitcoin’s halving event, expected later this month, will raise the prices of other tokens of the bitcoin ecosystem.\nFor the uninitiated, halving lowers the rate at which new bitcoin coins are minted, and therefore brings the new supply down.\nAs of now, the existing block reward is 6.25 BTC, which will drop to 3.125 BTC once the halving takes place.\nThe most recent halving took place on May 11, 2020, resulting in a 12 per cent increase in prices during the subsequent week. This month marks the fourth occurrence of such an event since 2012.\nHowever, some crypto experts have cautioned the investors against being too bullish on the halving event as it could create selling pressure in the days before and after the event, due on April 20.\nALSO READ: Bitcoin gained 150% in FY24, to remain in positive trajectory in FY25: Experts\nArthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX said in a blog post that when most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually happens.\n“The Bitcoin block reward is forecast to halve on April 20th. This is seen as a bullish catalyst for crypto markets. I agree that it will pump prices in the medium term; however, the price action directly before and after could be negative. The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched,” he wrote in his post on Heatwave.\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, also believes that investors could resort to profit-booking ahead of halving.\n“The upcoming halving in less than 10 days will reduce block rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin. This price action is a result of long-term investors booking profits ahead of the forthcoming halving. For instance, Grayscale (GBTC) had a net outflow of over 2,990 BTC,” says Thakral.\n“Traders should be careful about both bull and bear scenarios, as there is a good chance that some profit booking will take place at the time of halving as well,” CoinSwitch Markets Desk wrote in a statement.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

It’s an intriguing idea from a company with an awful lot to prove.\nToday, we’re getting the first announcement of the first Playtron-powered handheld, the SuiPlay0X1... but it’s probably not the proof we need? I laughed when I saw GamingOnLinux’s headline: “The first handheld to use PlaytronOS is some Web3 thing.”\nThe SuiPlay0X1 comes from Mysten Labs, one of Playtron’s seed investors, and right now, it’s a handful of concept renders around the idea that gamers might want a handheld (and game store) that cryptographically ties some games to Mysten’s Sui cryptocurrency and blockchain. That way, you could buy and own games on the blockchain. Mysten’s also promising crypto-incentives and rewards when you buy and play.\nAccording to interviews at Decrypt and VentureBeat, the SuiPlay0X1 will natively integrate Sui into its PlaytronOS — and Mysten claims to have “numerous game partners who are planning on launching games on the Sui blockchain,” writes VB’s Dean Takahashi. Mysten’s targeting a 2025 release date and a retail price of $500.\nIf good Sui-enabled Web3 games don’t materialize, well, PlaytronOS has access to Steam and the Epic Games Store, too, and $500 could be a competitive price for a good handheld by today’s standards.\nBut we’ve got no reason to think that this would be a good handheld yet, as these aren’t hardware companies, and they haven’t revealed a single spec — they’re not even sure what kind of chip it will contain. Here’s a passage from VentureBeat:\nThe architecture of the device is to be determined. It might be based on Advanced Micro Devices technology. But there are other system-on-chip vendors that Playtron is working with.\nPlaytron CEO Kirt McMaster tells me the company’s currently looking for a manufacturer to build the machines and to expect a follow-up announcement “in about three months” with specs and preorder opportunities.\nI’m not going to say the V word yet, but it feels a little early for Mysten to promise this handheld “will be available in stores worldwide in 2025.” Cool light bar, though.","While crypto bulls are celebrating bitcoin's 2024 surge as the first leg of a blowout rally to come, not all consumers are as optimistic about the token's prospects this year.\nAccording to a Deutsche Bank survey conducted in March, nearly one-third of global consumers expect the apex coin to plunge below $20,000 by the end of 2024.\nThat would represent a plummet of over 70% from bitcoin's current valuation, which stood at $68,652 as of 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\nIn stark contrast, some of the asset's most outspoken proponents have argued that it will punch past the $100,000 threshold in the same timeframe.\nFor instance, it's a view long put out by Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who also anticipates the coin to reach as high as $200,000 next year. Bernstein strategists have also ratcheted up their outlook, expecting a $150,000 valuation by 2025.\nIt's an optimism that's chiefly sprung out from this year's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, considered as a major amplifier for crypto demand. Already, these funds have helped propel the currency 63% year-to-date.\nMeanwhile, this month's anticipated halving event will lower bitcoin output, putting upside pressure on its price.\nRising adoption is why crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz expects $50,000 to be bitcoin's newest price floor, a level it's unlikely to revisit, he said in March.\nBut according to the survey, only 10% of consumers see the token reaching past $75,000 this year. That would be just over the $73,000 peak bitcoin reached in last month, before paring gains.\nThe price pessimism could be explained by the fact that 38% of respondents expect bitcoin to \"disappear\" in the next few years, just below 40% who believe it will thrive."]}

Goldman Sachs (GS), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Bank of America (BAC) are next up, with earnings due early in the week. The Dow will keep busy with, in addition to Goldman, three other Dow names due to report. Netflix headlines the tech-sector's earnings. And followers of cryptocurrencies are hotly anticipating bitcoin's fourth official halving event, and its uncertain impact on the industry.\nWith the market still in a sideways pattern, a number of stocks are using the pause to forge bases. Nvidia (NVDA), the company and stock of the AI revolution, has just forged a new flat base along its 21-day moving average after flashing buy signals earlier in the week. Investment manager Ares Management (ARES) and trucking firm Saia (SAIA) are trading very tight, also in flat bases that show some early entry options. Denmark-based weight-loss drug giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) has a flat base as well, and has also pulled back in a test of support at its 10-week moving average. Uranium giant Cameco (CCJ) is flirting with a breakout.\nEconomic data in the coming week will feature retail sales and a raft of housing reports, and could have some modest impact on the Fed's rate cut strategy. March retail sales, out Monday, have been sluggish lately, but economists expect a moderate 0.35% rise overall, or 0.5% minus autos. Soft data or substantial downward revisions could support expectations that the U.S. economy is heading for a soft landing. A big upside surprise would cast more doubt on coming rate cuts. Outside of retail sales, only weekly jobless claims on Thursday, may have market-moving impact — if the upward trend many economists have anticipated finally begins to emerge.\nHow Will Markets Respond To Iran Attack Vs. Israel?\nInternet television network Netflix (NFLX) will release its first-quarter results late Thursday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Netflix to earn $4.51 a share on sales of $9.27 billion in the March quarter. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 56.6% in earnings and 13.6% in revenue. It also would mark the company's third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Analysts predict Netflix will add 4.88 million net new subscribers in the first quarter. It ended 2023 with 260.28 million subscribers worldwide. Netflix shares sit on a six-month gain, up almost 28% this year and 80% above an October low. The stock is now less than 13% from its record high, set in November 2021.\nThe bitcoin economy moves toward a process it calls \"the halving,\" a 50% cut in the rewards paid to the blockchain processors known as miners. The change, intended the slow the roll out of the currency's capped supply, is expected April 18 to 21. It is likely to pressure the price of bitcoin higher, eventually. Meanwhile, it could cause a shakeout among miners.\nBitcoin Mining Braces For A Shakeout As Halving Nears\nEarnings season gets underway in earnest for Dow industrials in the coming week with Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IBM (IBM) and Travelers (TRV) all set to deliver results. In that group, Travelers is the year's fastest mover — up 16% — with FactSet projecting an 18% earnings gain. The others face lower targets. Goldman is poised for a rebound from support. Travelers is also testing support, after a run-up following its January breakout.\nAt the end of March, the stock market traded at a 3% premium over the composite of fair values, Morningstar reported. Heading into earning season, that doesn't necessarily put the market into overvalued territory. But it's important to note that, since 2010, the market has traded at this much of a premium (or more) only 14% of the time. Morningstar expects ongoing gains to diversify, getting away from the artificial intelligence concentration, as investors rotate into undervalued segments. Morningstar says value stocks currently trade at a 6% discount to fair value. Small cap stocks are undervalued by 18%.\nIn April 2023 the banking sector was busy assessing what led to the prior month's meltdowns of Silicon Valley (SIVBQ) and Signature Bank of New York (SBNY). The U.S. economy slowed to 1.1% growth in Q1. China's economy appeared to be rebounding after the release of Covid era restrictions. The S&P 500 had bounced off a March low and was headed toward a short-term high in July. The 10-year yield was around 3.39, getting ready to rally as markets worried over ongoing Fed rate increases. At the end of April, President Joe Biden would announce plans to run again for the presidency.\nCharles Schwab has been on a losing streak, with earnings falling and revenue growth slowing to nil for the past three quarters. Analysts see the trend continuing when it reports Q1 results on Monday, with EPS down 21% and an 8% revenue slip. Shares are off about 3% year to date, but up 46% from an October low.\nBank of America delivers its first-quarter report early Tuesday. The bank broke a four-quarter earnings and revenue advance in Q4. FactSet points to a change of luck for Q1, targeting a 17% earnings drop. Shares are just off their highest level in 17 months.\nUnited Airlines (UAL) has pulled back heading into Tuesday morning's earnings report. Earnings slowed from big gains in '22 and '23 to a slump in Q4. Analysts see a modest Q1 rebound, as sales growth dips to single digits. The stock has been flying low since the 2020 crash, but it's up 30% from an October low.\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) has run up nearly 18% after the most recent in a string of breakouts. FactSet sees the outfit's luck holding, expecting a 21% earnings jump and an equal rise in revenue in a Tuesday afternoon report. Shares ended Friday a fraction below their 21-day moving average.\nASML Holding (ASML) will post its first-quarter results early Wednesday. Analysts predict the Netherlands-based chip gear leader will earn $3 a share, down 40% year over year, on sales of $5.52 billion, down 18%. ASML's sales have been negatively impacted by export restrictions to China.\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) reports first-quarter results late Thursday. FactSet expects adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share on $1.87 billion in sales. Earnings would climb more than 15% as sales rise about 10%. Shares have formed a flat base, and are testing support at their 10-week moving average.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

This industry is continuously making progress and proving to be a new asset class. The Security Exchange Commission of the US recently approved the first US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) to track Bitcoin. This move has given the industry exposure that is no less than remarkable.”\nHe adds that several countries, including India, regularized this industry several years ago. “India, for example, charges a 30 per cent tax on crypto gains, similar to the tax charged on capital gains on shares.” Work in Pakistan, however, has been slow in this regard.\nWeb3 and digital asset consultant Arsalan Khan says that cryptocurrencies are now a $2.5 trillion market. With some unofficial numbers suggesting that Pakistan has over 20 million registered accounts with different exchanges, Khan says that “this is almost equal to the number of bank accounts in the country. So the scope for digital assets is definitely there, and with the Pakistani rupee devaluing, crypto will remain an alternate store of value.”\nAccording to Bismil, Pakistani policies have driven away “thousands of crypto traders” who have migrated to countries like the UAE, Turkey and the US, “all of which provide a legal framework and a safe work environment for this industry.” He also thinks that by not recognizing this digital asset, Pakistan is missing out on much-needed tax revenue “because this industry is entirely non-taxable in Pakistan.”\nBut cryptocurrencies have had their fair share of scandals. In 2023, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, was fined $4.3 billion by the US government for its involvement in money laundering. In 2022, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange, ‘FTX’ crashed. These factors make the market more volatile, raising scepticism among market experts.\nChief Executive Officer of Invents Global Amar Makhdoom highlights the risks involved. According to him, “cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose risks to Pakistan’s financial stability due to their volatile nature and lack of regulation. Platforms like Binance, if not carefully monitored, could facilitate money laundering and capital flight, harming the country’s financial system.”\nHe adds that “a lot of Pakistani tech companies invested in crypto, but now that the retention is 50 per cent, they are bringing cash back into our system.”\nWhat should Pakistan do then? Per Arsalan Khan, “As for Pakistan, we need to regulate the on-ramp and off-ramp sides of crypto first. Peer-to-peer transactions need to be licenced. Exchange companies are supportive enough to share data with governments.\nWe should allow the conversion of fiat into crypto via our banking channels. We need to understand that it is nothing but data, and monetizing that data for the country is the second step. So far, our government has skipped the first step and is only looking to tax, which, in my opinion, will again create parallel economies.”\nTeams have already started landing in Karachi for mega event planned and finalised following series of recent meetings\nPTI’s MPA Ahmer Rasheed Bhatti and PPP’s MPA Syed Ali Haider Gilani have officially joined committee\nThis will be Aurangzeb's second budget speech after assuming office\n“Is this a joke?

Under CEO Cathie Wood, the company manages thematic exchange-traded funds (ETF) built around various technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency.\nArk has long been bullish on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). In 2015, it became the first public fund manager to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency, which traded around $200 at the time. Nearly a decade has passed, and Bitcoin is now worth $70,000, but Wood and her team still see substantial upside for investors.\nThe company published a Bitcoin valuation model in 2023 that posited a price of $1.5 million by 2030. That implies more than 2,000% upside from its current price. But Ark quietly revised its target higher after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Wood made that information public at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference last month, saying:\nLast year, we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.\nIn short, Ark now believes Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million, presumably by 2030, though Wood didn't provide a specific time frame. The upside implied by the new target exceeds 5,300%. One way investors can capitalize on that is by purchasing a position in the iShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT), a recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nUntil recently, getting direct Bitcoin exposure was a cumbersome and costly process for U.S. investors. They had to create and fund an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, where they usually had to pay exorbitant commissions on each transaction. For instance, Coinbase charges about 1.5% for simple trades. Additionally, investors who wanted complete control of their Bitcoin had to move the cryptocurrency to a specific type of blockchain wallet.\nFortunately, things got easier when the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Those investment vehicles track the price of Bitcoin while eliminating the hassle of cryptocurrency exchanges, high fees, and specialized storage solutions. Ark highlighted those benefits in a recent report:\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs set the stage for Bitcoin's growth by offering investors a more direct, regulated, and liquid way to gain exposure. Bitcoin spot ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts, and should reduce the learning curve and operational complexities associated with direct investments in Bitcoin.\nThe SEC has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, all of which do the same thing: track the price of Bitcoin. The only consequential differences lie in the expense ratios and the reputations of the issuers.\nWith that in mind, investors should consider the iShares Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock. It bears the third-lowest expense ratio of 0.25%, and BlackRock has a sterling reputation that comes with being the world's largest asset manager.\nArk Invest believes spot Bitcoin ETFs will eventually capture more than 5% of institutional assets under management (AUM). For context, consultancy PwC believes institutional AUM will reach $145 trillion by 2025. Using that figure, Ark's prediction implies that institutional investors will eventually allocate about $8 trillion to Bitcoin. That may be a stretch.\nOn one hand, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly been a success. The ETFs issued by BlackRock and Fidelity saw more inflows during their first month on the market than any other ETFs in history, according to Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF became the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in assets, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nOn the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs had collectively accumulated just $57 billion in assets as of April 4, according to The Block. Even if every penny came from institutional investors, which is certainly not true, that figure would need to increase 140-fold to reach $8 trillion. I doubt that will happen in the near future, so readers should not bank on Bitcoin reaching $3.8 million any time soon.\nThat said, the iShares Bitcoin ETF is still a worthwhile purchase for risk-tolerant investors. Bitcoin easily outperformed stocks, bonds, gold, commodities, and real estate over the last five years. Additionally, any investor who has bought and held Bitcoin for at least five years has profited, no matter when they made their purchase, according to Ark Invest. That makes for a compelling investment thesis.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn’t one of them.

Get exclusive investment industry news and insights, the week’s top headlines, and what you and your clients need to know. For more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage.\nBitcoin is trading close to its all-time high, but new competition from south of the border has led many investors to withdraw funds from most Canadian bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nSpot bitcoin ETFs in Canada have seen $655-million in outflows this year as of March 31, according to Linda Ma, vice-president of ETFs and financial products research at National Bank Financial Markets in Toronto. On the other hand, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January after receiving long-awaited regulatory approval, have brought in US$40.8-billion.\nThe movement in assets comes as the crypto asset is trading in the US$65,000 range after hitting a record high of more than US$73,000 in mid-March.\nSpot bitcoin ETFs had an almost three-year head start in Canada, with Purpose Investments Inc. launching Purpose Bitcoin ETF BTCC-B-T in February, 2021. While still the largest crypto ETF based in Canada, with $2.7-billion in assets under management between its currency-hedged, unhedged, U.S.-dollar versions, the fund has seen outflows of $513-million this year, according to National Bank data.\n“Everyone knew there would be some pent-up demand and there would be a lot of investor interest in the space,” says Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments in Toronto, about the introduction of crypto ETFs in the U.S. “Even the most optimistic of people are surprised at just how much demand there has been.”\nCase in point: BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT-Q has seen US$14-billion in inflows since it began trading in January.\nTo further spur that demand, U.S. providers launched their products with low management fees, ranging between 0.19 and 0.30 per cent. Several asset managers also waived management fees entirely for a set period. The management fees for Canadian spot bitcoin ETFs range from 0.39 to 1 per cent, with the management expense ratios (MERs) between 0.44 and 2.18 per cent. The MERs for the U.S. products aren’t available because they haven’t been around for a full year.\n“We saw one of the craziest fee wars that I’ve ever seen,” says Andrew Clee, vice-president of product at Fidelity Investments Canada ULC in Toronto.\nFidelity responded to the U.S. launches by reducing the management fee on its Canada-listed Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF FBTC-T to 0.39 per cent. (The U.S.-listed Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund’s FBTC-A 0.25 per cent management fee was waived until Aug. 1.)\n“Given the access to U.S. markets for Canadian investors, fees are a very important part of the investment decision, so we wanted to be priced competitively to still attract Canadian retail assets,” Mr. Clee says.\nThe move may have paid off. Compared with the outflows from the unhedged and U.S.-dollar versions of Purpose Bitcoin ETF and from CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCX-B-T (0.40 per cent management fee and $162-million in outflows year to date between the two versions, according to National Bank data), Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF has brought in $118-million, Ms. Ma says.\nSo far, other manufacturers have been reluctant to compete on price. “It’s something we’re definitely going to keep on top of, but right now we haven’t made any changes to our management fee,” Mr. Taylor says.\nAlmost two-thirds of the outflows from Canadian spot bitcoin ETFs are from the U.S.-dollar versions, Ms. Ma says, which could suggest many U.S. investors – both retail and institutional – are switching to U.S.-based products.\n“We were the only game in town, so we had a lot of interest from U.S. funds and institutions,” Mr. Taylor says. “It’s natural to expect that once they have a U.S. product they will start to gravitate toward that. Some of the flows have just been U.S. investors who are [choosing] U.S. funds.”\nMeanwhile, the currency-hedged version of Purpose Bitcoin ETF BTCC-T has seen inflows of $35-million year to date.\nPerhaps counterintuitively, bitcoin’s strong performance this year may also be playing a part in the outflows, Ms. Ma says. The Canadian ETFs launched in 2021 and many investors purchased the products close to bitcoin’s pandemic peak before watching their investment crash.\n“With the prices now coming to historical highs, maybe people are getting out of the asset class because they’ve been waiting for an exit point,” she says.\nWhile that may be true in some cases, Mr. Taylor says bitcoin’s rebound means more investors are paying attention to the asset class again. The funds will begin to benefit from an increase in the pool of investors looking for exposure, he says: “It’s no longer just a niche asset that you can ignore.”\nHe also points to the “halving” event this month, a mechanism built into bitcoin’s underlying blockchain software that will reduce the amount of bitcoin mined. The reduction in supply comes amid the increased demand from U.S. ETF investors.\nMichael Zagari, associate portfolio manager at Mandeville Private Client Inc. in Montreal, says this all contributes to “a support level built in now to bitcoin.” He’s bullish on cryptocurrency, allocating 3 per cent to 5 per cent of client portfolios to the asset class.\nHowever, the introduction of U.S. ETFs hasn’t affected Mr. Zagari’s strategy. “I would caution investors on just chasing the lowest fee,” he says, when it comes to bitcoin ETFs.\nCanadian funds have a track record and the benefit of simplicity. For example, while bitcoin ETFs typically don’t pay distributions, he says, investing in Canadian funds means there won’t be any cross-border complications during tax season.\nFor more from Globe Advisor, visit our homepage.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nEditorial code of conduct\nStudy and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

The top cryptocurrency fell to $59,900 on Wednesday for the first time since early March, almost 17% below its all-time high.\nMany of the other major cryptocurrencies also dropped Wednesday, including the second-largest, Ether, which has gone below $3,000, according to crypto tracking website CoinMarketCap.\nThe Bitcoin halving is due on April 19, cutting the current mining rate to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25 Bitcoin. Halving is an integral part of the Bitcoin blockchain system, which creates a monetary system that controls inflation. While this major event has been projected to possibly increase Bitcoin’s price in the long term, Bitcoin’s price has been increasingly volatile recently and will likely continue to be going into the halving.\nThere has been a lot of discussion about this year’s Bitcoin halving being different from all the previous such events. The cryptocurrency’s price reached its peak a month before the halving event, which has never happened before.\nSam Callahan, a senior analyst at Swan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin financial services firm, says Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase. “The recent volatility is likely a result of short-term traders placing bets on the outcome of the highly anticipated halving event,” Callahan said in an email.\n“If an investor chooses to own Bitcoin, short-term volatility should be expected, but if they zoom out, Bitcoin’s long-term trend remains clear.”\nBitcoin halving has historically boosted the price of the cryptocurrency.\nFor instance, after the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, the price was $12. It went up to $44 100 days after the event and $135 after 300 days.\nSimilarly, after the 2016 halving event, the cryptocurrency went from $658 to $1,551 in 300 days.\nAnd in the most recent halving of 2020, the price of $8,601 went to $50,941 within 300 days.\nRead more: The big Bitcoin ‘halving’ event is almost here. We’ve got answers to all your questions\nCoinDesk reports that Goldman Sachs warns caution due to unpredictable macroeconomic factors regarding Bitcoin’s upcoming halving.\n“Historically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly,” said Goldman’s Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities team per CoinDesk. “Caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions.”\nIn the midst of investor nervousness as well as Bitcoin’s volatility, Rennick Palley, a Founding Partner at Stratos, a crypto venture capital firm, remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term performance.\n“There are two headwinds for Bitcoin in the short term, the volatile pre-halving period as well as prior all-time highs, which typically take 2 to 3 attempts to definitively breach,” he said in an email.\n“However we expect bitcoin to break through this by mid summer and continue towards 150k plus by 2025.”\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Immediate Cipro is an advanced trading platform that can help you with crypto trading by making the trading process seamless and profitable.

BlockDAG, known for its innovative approach to blockchain technology, has achieved impressive presale figures, indicating a strong interest from investors.\nAs 2024 goes on, the focus is shifting towards platforms that offer novel solutions, and BlockDAG is leading the way, promising a 20,000X return on investment. In an era ripe for technological breakthroughs, BlockDAG is not only catching the eye of investors but also making history with its extraordinary promotional strategies, including a planned keynote from the moon.\nSolana: Optimistic yet Uncertain Outlook\nSolana has been a hot topic among investors, particularly concerning its price projections. The platform is celebrated for its ability to conduct transactions rapidly and cheaply. Although it has experienced a recent surge, experts advise caution and recommend keeping an eye on market trends due to potential price swings. Solana’s distinctive Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism distinguishes it, but its future in a volatile market is still debatable.\nLitecoin’s Positive Trends\nConversely, Litecoin has been showing signs of a strong comeback. Known as the silver to Bitcoinâs gold, this peer-to-peer cryptocurrency has witnessed market improvements, hinting at a renewed interest that could narrow the gap with Bitcoin. However, it remains to be seen whether Litecoin can maintain this momentum. With a solid history and continuous updates, Litecoin remains a noteworthy crypto asset.\nBlockDAG With a 20,000X Growth Potential and $17.8M Presale\nWith its pioneering DAG chain technology, BlockDAG is setting itself apart as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency arena. This breakthrough represents a significant departure from traditional blockchains, offering improved scalability, security, and decentralization. Starting at an initial presale price of $0.001 per coin, which has already risen to $0.0050, early backers are seeing promising returns. The presale phases have concluded swiftly, reflecting the community’s strong belief in BlockDAGâs future.\nThe technology underpinning BlockDAG combines the PHANTOM protocol and GHOSTDAG algorithm, providing a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to the conventional Proof of Work system. This advancement facilitates quicker, more secure transactions and equips the platform to handle future demands effectively.

According to the forecast, the cryptocurrency could experience a significant drop below the $60,000 mark before potentially witnessing a ‘hate halving rally.’\nWhat Happened: IncomeSharks took to X to share its forecast. The analyst suggested that Bitcoin might dip below the $60,000 level, which could prompt panic selling. The analyst believes that this would be a necessary step to clear out the remaining holders who are relying on the support to hold.\n“#Bitcoin – Still think we break and close below $60k to get another round of panic sellers gone. People probably still holding thinking support is holding. We need to break them first. Then we can get a hate halving rally,” the analyst said.\n#Bitcoin – Still think we break and close below $60k to get another round of panic sellers gone. People probably still holding thinking support is holding. We need to break them first. Then we can get a hate halving rally. pic.twitter.com\/LHrQhMJwgA\nIncomeSharks’ prediction comes at a crucial time, just days before the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. This process, which occurs approximately every four years, is designed to introduce anti-deflationary features to Bitcoin. Historically, this event has led to a surge in the cryptocurrency’s price.\nSee Also: Elon Musk Teases Dogecoin Tweet But DOGE Fails To Rally From 20% Weekly Correction\nWhy It Matters: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event has been a topic of intense speculation. Many analysts and investors are closely watching to see how this event will impact the market. Some experts believe that the halving could transform the market and lead to a significant price increase.\nThe analyst’s prediction aligns with the recent market volatility. Ali Martinez, another crypto analyst, highlighted the $62,000 level as a critical support zone for Bitcoin. Failure to maintain this level could shift focus to the next significant demand area, around $51,500. However, Martinez also pointed out a potential trigger for a bullish trend. If Bitcoin manages to climb back above $66,250, it could significantly boost the chances of a resurgence in the market.\nMeanwhile, notable financial commentator Jim Cramer recently advised against investing in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA), a company involved in Bitcoin mining, and instead recommended Bitcoin or Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as alternatives.\nPrice Action: Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,562, showing a 0.48% increase in the last 24 hours and a notable 39.37% gain year to date, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next: Shiba Inu Down 20% On The Week, But: These ‘Proven Milestones’ Could Lead To ‘Massive Bull Market,’ Touts\nImage Via Shutterstock\nEngineered by\n        Benzinga Neuro, Edited by\n        \n\n              Kaustubh Bagalkote\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the\n        extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to\n        create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n        Learn more."]}

Based on current projections, the upcoming halving is expected to occur either late Friday or early Saturday.\nAlso read: Bitcoin falls 8% in five days; here are 4 reasons behind the plunge\nThe halving refers to an alteration in the foundational blockchain technology of Bitcoin, aimed at decreasing the pace of generating new bitcoins.\nSince its creation by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has been structured to possess a finite supply of 21 million tokens.\nThis marks the fourth halving event in Bitcoin's history. The initial halving in 2012 saw the reward drop from $50 to $25. The most recent halving will further reduce the reward to $3.125, equivalent to nearly $200,000 at current prices, with Bitcoin trading at $64,000 as of April 19.\nThe process of halving will persist until 2041, by which time all Bitcoins will have been mined. However, this particular Bitcoin halving event is anticipated to deviate from its predecessors due to recent geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, which have stirred market instability. Consequently, Bitcoin witnessed a significant downturn, plummeting to its lowest level in a month. On Friday, during the Asia session, Bitcoin experienced a decline exceeding 5.5%, falling to $59,961.\n“In the long term, this supply reduction could attract more institutional and retail capital while amplifying Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio. ZebPay is bullish about both the short-term as well as long-term outlook for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin halving expected on April 20, here's what it means; should you invest?\nExperts say that the halving event might impact Bitcoin's price as its heightened scarcity could result in upward pressure on prices and attract a wave of new investors to the cryptocurrency market.\nTypically, Bitcoin experiences a significant rally approximately 60 days before the halving event. This has been observed consistently in the past cycles, including 2016 and 2020, where the cryptocurrency often reaches new all-time highs, according to experts\nFollowing the rally, there is often a retrace period that tends to occur around 28 to 14 days before the halving. This pattern is highlighted in the 2020 cycle with a 19% retrace and in the 2016 cycle with a more pronounced retrace of up to 40% when accounting for downside wicks.\nRajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX, said, “After the halving, Bitcoin typically enters a phase of sideways movement, which can be termed as reaccumulation. This phase generally occurs at levels around old all-time highs, preparing the market for the next impulsive wave of price increases. Historical data shows that after the reaccumulation phase post-halving, Bitcoin tends to experience a parabolic rise in price. This pattern is evident in the discussions of post-2020 halving events, where a significant upward movement followed the halving and reaccumulation phases.”\nMenon further added, “ The general consensus is that prices should go up because of the supply shock but geo political events such as the threat could cause the market to plunge as it did over last weekend.”\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

All long-term stock market investors will relate to this famous quote by Charlie Munger too well. But, this investing adage is not limited to just investors in the securities markets.\nHODLers, or holders of cryptocurrencies, too swear by this mantra, standing out from the crowd of fly-by-night investors who buy and sell crypto for a quick buck. HODLer refers to an individual who holds their cryptocurrencies for the long term, despite the market volatility.\nIt is not just volatility that HODLers have to watch out for, they also have to bear up against regulatory uncertainties, heavy taxation, possible bans and the general negative view on the digital currencies. So, what keeps them going? For one, it is their belief in the potential of these virtual currencies.\nMumbai-based Vishal Rajesh Soni, a fixed income dealer, bought his first cryptocurrency in 2018, when he was only 19 years old. “I like exploring new investment opportunities. In 2018, when bitcoin was suddenly in the news, I started learning how cryptocurrencies work. When I discovered the concept of decentralized currency and the technology used to build these currencies, I realized there are several benefits to it and I started investing,\" he said.\nIn Delhi, Anuj Chaudhary, got a chance to understand virtual digital assets (VDAs) and its working in 2020 while working as a market reporter with an international news organization. He got hooked to it and decided to switch careers to work with crypto exchanges and crypto-based companies in the space.\n“I want to be a part of the growth of this industry. I bought my first cryptocurrency in 2020 and despite market crashes and negative news, I've remained steadfast in my HODLing strategy,\" said Chaudhary, who works as a crypto analyst in an open-source blockchain platform.\nBitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is rallying again. Its price has increased nearly 112% in the last one year. This rally followed a year of stagnant prices hovering around $20,000-30,000 through 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023. From its peak of $61,000 in October 2021, bitcoin price fell by nearly 75% over the next one year. Bitcoin touched an all-time high in mid-March to trade at $73,000.\nHowever, HODLers remain unfazed by the drastic swings in the prices of cryptocurrencies.\nShramana Chatterjee, a 27-year-old marketing professional, entered the cryptocurrency market during the 2021 bull run. So, the drawdown that followed soon after did dampen her spirits after she saw her portfolio in the red, but she decided against panic selling.\n“After the market significantly dropped post 2021’s peak, I started reading up more about the assets I had invested in rather than having a cursory knowledge about them. I understood the ‘sell the news’ phenomenon, price manipulations and other factors that could affect my assets,\" she said.\nAbout 33% of Chatterjee’s overall investment portfolio is in cryptocurrencies and she gradually recovered her losses when the market started looking up around late 2021. Her crypto holdings have grown about 44% till date. “A lot of believers have stuck around despite the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) and it has definitely helped them have a better perspective of virtual digital assets and their future,\" said 27-year-old Chaterjee.\nSome HODLers even see drawdowns as an opportunity to invest more, as is the case with Soni. “For me, drawdowns are more like an opportunity and I allocate additional money to my crypto portfolio apart from the systematic investments that I am making monthly. Even if bitcoin loses 90% value, I will invest additional capital in it,\" he said. Soni has gradually increased exposure of his investment portfolio in cryptos from 2-3% to 30%, while the rest is in equities and gold.\nOn being asked whether the price fluctuations scare him, given that a third of his total portfolio is in this extremely volatile asset class, he said it doesn’t affect him at all. “Because crypto is not a matured asset class, it is bound to be extremely volatile and historically this market has sees 80-90% drawdown since 2009 and I am always mentally prepared for such events in future,\" he said.\nWhat will HODLers do with crypto?HODLers approach their crypto portfolio allocation with a mix of strategic planning and belief in the long-term potential of digital assets based on their set of goals and unique perspectives.\n\n     \n      For Shramana, her crypto portfolio is for long-term wealth creation. But, she has carefully diversified in other asset classes as well as she is cognizant of the volatile nature of this asset class. \n\n     \n      “I am interested in building a strong wealth portfolio with crypto which seems quite achievable given the market trajectory. However, I am also apprised of the vulnerabilities and other factors that come with any investment asset. So, I follow the simple rule of not putting all my wealth in one single asset, be it crypto or otherwise,\" she said.\n\n     \n      Soni said he does not have any specific plans for his crypto portfolio yet. He wants to remain invested and let long-term compounding do its magic. His crypto portfolio has grown 5X since he started investing.\n\n     \n      Despite their belief in the VDAs, some HODLers want to tread cautiously given there are no clear regulations around these in India and the central bank has repeatedly mulled banning them. Chaudhary has limited his exposure to cryptos to 5% of his overall portfolio so far. “It’s only because of the regulatory uncertainty and the strict tax rules introduced recently.\n\n     \n      Chaudhary pointed out that cryptos has surpassed his traditional investment avenues by a substantial margin. He intends to increase his allocation to cryptos to 10% over the next few months as he is confident about the Indian authorities warming up to the space soon. \n\n     \n      “I will liquidate a part of my real estate portfolio and divert the capital to cryptos. My long-term aspirations include achieving financial freedom and potentially starting my blockchain-based start-up and I believe my crypto investments can help achieve these goals,\" said Chaudhary.\n\nTaxation & regulatory hurdles\n\n     \n      In Budget 2022, the government imposed a steep 30% tax on capital gains earned from cryptocurrencies, irrespective of the holding period (see graphic). This shook the crypto industry, even forced some major exchanges to move base to tax-friendly countries like Dubai.\n\n     \n      “This tax treatment discourages the long-term investors who are crucial for a healthy crypto ecosystem. Long-term investors can help to stabilize prices and attract institutional investors who seek a more predictable market,\" said a senior official working at a crypto exchange in India.\n\n     \n      Given the tax implications, most HODLers have decided to not withdraw their holdings unless they need the capital.\n\n     \n      “Tax implications heavily influence my decision-making process. With a 30% tax on profits and 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) on every transaction, I prefer to hold onto my investments rather than incur significant capital locking on high-frequency trading,\" said Chaudhary.\n\n     \n      The one lesson to take away from HODLers is the importance of having a long-term perspective when it comes to investing. HODLers believe in the potential of their investments and are willing to stay invested across market cycles for long-term gains.\n\n     \n      Soni firmly believes cryptos are evolving and will become a mainstream asset class in the future. “Investors didn’t take the US dollar seriously when it started trading. Investors used to trade currencies like Philippines peso but these currencies have disappeared after the dollar reigned. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will also evolve in a few decades,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\n     \n      Mint does not recommend investing in cryptocurrency. It is neither backed by an underlying asset, nor is its legal status clear in India.\nHODLers approach their crypto portfolio allocation with a mix of strategic planning and belief in the long-term potential of digital assets based on their set of goals and unique perspectives.\nFor Shramana, her crypto portfolio is for long-term wealth creation.

That’s according to an analysis from JPMorgan, CoinDesk reports. The bank has predicted a decline in the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency due to overbought market conditions.\nMoreover, the current cryptocurrency price of approximately $61,200 remains above the bank’s volatility-adjusted comparison with gold of $45,000, CoinDesk reports.\nThe Bitcoin halving will occur around April 19-20, cutting the current mining rate to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25 Bitcoin. Halving is an integral part of the Bitcoin blockchain system, which creates a monetary system that controls inflation.\nAfter briefly dropping below $60,000 a day earlier, Bitcoin was down 1.17% on Thursday morning, hovering around $62,000, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThere has been a lot of discussion about this year’s Bitcoin halving being different from all the previous such events, primarily because the top cryptocurrency’s price reached its peak a month before the halving event, which has never happened before.\nHistorically, Bitcoin halving has boosted the price of the cryptocurrency. For instance, after the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, the price was $12. It went up to $44 100 days after the event and $135 after 300 days.\nSimilarly, after the 2016 halving event, the cryptocurrency went from $658 to $1,551 in 300 days. And in the most recent halving of 2020, the price of $8,601 went to $50,941 within 300 days.\nRead more: The big Bitcoin ‘halving’ event is almost here. We’ve got answers to all your questions\nThis time around, banking giants are not sure that the trend will continue given the market conditions. Recently, Goldman Sachs warned caution due to unpredictable macroeconomic factors regarding Bitcoin’s upcoming halving.\n“Historically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly,” said Goldman’s Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities team, per CoinDesk. “Caution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions.”\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","The\nBlockDAG team has just increased the excitement for their project by releasing a teaser for the keynote video on the moon. With its current presale price poised at a mere $0.005 and predictions of a staggering 30,000X return on investment (ROI), this innovative platform is capturing the attention of investors worldwide.\nLeveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG offers an intriguing alternative to conventional blockchain systems, blending speed, security, and scalability. BlockDAG is poised to rival the likes of Chainlink and Solana in potential and market impact, as it leverages the latest crypto mining rigs to secure its place in the digital currency landscape.\nChainlink’s Potential Price Trajectory\nChainlink (LINK) continues to attract attention with its robust framework for integrating real-world data into blockchains. Crypto analyst MichaÃ«l van de Poppe recently highlighted a potential turning point for LINK. Despite a significant price drop, resulting in a 37.50 per cent decline, the subsequent recovery patternâmarked by higher lows and higher highsâsuggests a bullish reversal might be on the horizon.\nWith a current price increase of 6.97 per cent to $14.41, LINK exhibits resilience and a neutral momentum, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This neutral stance juxtaposed with critical resistance levels posits LINK as ripe for a breakout, signalling a “massive opportunity” for early investors.\nSolana’s Rising Momentum\nSolana has demonstrated significant resilience and innovation, positioning itself as a strong competitor in the blockchain arena. With a recent price surge of over 7 per cent, Solana showcases growth and the capacity to implement novel blockchain solutions that extend beyond financial transactions. Solanaâs architecture supports high-speed and cost-effective transactions, making it an attractive platform for developers and investors. The potential for further bullish trends remains high, echoing the innovative strides seen in other high-performing altcoins.\nBlockDAG ’s Technological and Presale Progress 30000X ROI Potential\nBlockDAG is revolutionising the crypto space with a unique hybrid structure that leverages the best features of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and traditional blockchain technologies. The DAGPaper V2 highlights how this ingenious blend accelerates transactions and enhances scalability while maintaining high-security standards, ensuring robust defense against cyber threats.\nThe excitement around the BlockDAG project has been replaced with the teaser release of the keynote video from the moon. This unique endeavour in crypto aims to catapult the project to unprecedented popularity and reach, marking the BlockDAG presale as a historical event in cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the\ncurrent keynote sheds light on the significant price jump to $0.05 upon listing. The upcoming batch will see a price surge of 0.001 from the current $0.005, underscoring the robust growth and 30,000x ROI potential in the platform’s roadmap.\nBlockDAG’s rapid advancement is evidenced by the swift progression through its presale batches, with each batch marking a price increase of $0.0005, leading up to the monumental batch 10, which will establish a new price baseline of $0.001. This incremental pricing strategy highlights the platformâs solid performance and growth potential, making it an attractive proposition for early investors. With over 4600 miners sold and over 7.6 billion BDAG coins snapped up, generating $18.1 Million in presale revenue and an additional $2.2 million from miner sales, BlockDAG is setting a new standard for investment opportunities in the crypto world.\nFinal Thoughts\nBlockDAG’s strategic initiatives have already led to impressive financial outcomes, with over $18.1 Million raised in presales and an additional $2.2 million from crypto mining rig sales. The platform’s price increment strategy, culminating soon in batch 10 at $0.006 per coin, illustrates a strong market demand and investor confidence. As BlockDAG continues to release innovative updates and expand its products, it stands as a compelling choice for those seeking potent returns, mirroring or surpassing the successes of established players like Chainlink and Solana in cryptocurrency.\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\nWebsite:Â \nhttps:\/\/blockdag.network\nPresale:Â \nhttps:\/\/purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram:Â \nhttps:\/\/t.me\/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord:Â \nhttps:\/\/discord.gg\/Q7BxghMVyu\nAbove mentioned article is consumer connect initiative.This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic\/editorial involvement of Firstpost and Firstpost claims no responsibility whatsoever."]}

And, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nWHAT IS BITCOIN HALVING AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\nBitcoin “halving,” a preprogrammed event that occurs roughly every four years, impacts the production of bitcoin. Miners use farms of noisy, specialized computers to solve convoluted math puzzles; and when they complete one, they get a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward.\nHalving does exactly what it sounds like — it cuts that fixed income in half. And when the mining reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. That means the supply of coins available to satisfy demand grows more slowly.\nLimited supply is one of bitcoin’s key features. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and more than 19.5 million of them have already been mined, leaving fewer than 1.5 million left to pull from.\nSo long as demand remains the same or climbs faster than supply, bitcoin prices should rise as halving limits output. Because of this, some argue that bitcoin can counteract inflation — still, experts stress that future gains are never guaranteed.\nHOW OFTEN DOES HALVING OCCUR?\nPer bitcoin’s code, halving occurs after the creation of every 210,000 “blocks” — where transactions are recorded — during the mining process.\nNo calendar dates are set in stone, but that divvies out to roughly once every four years. The latest estimates expect the next halving to occur sometime late Friday or early Saturday.\nWILL HALVING IMPACT BITCOIN’S PRICE?\nOnly time will tell. Following each of the three previous halvings, the price of bitcoin was mixed in the first few months and wound up significantly higher one year later. But as investors well know, past performance is not an indicator of future results.\n“I don’t know how significant we can say halving is just yet,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko. “The sample size of three (previous halvings) isn’t big enough to say ‘It’s going to go up 500% again,’ or something.”\nAt the time of the last halving in May 2020, for example, bitcoin’s price stood at around $8,602, according to CoinMarketCap — and climbed almost seven-fold to nearly $56,705 by May 2021. Bitcoin prices nearly quadrupled a year after July 2016’s halving and shot up by almost 80 times one year out from bitcoin’s first halving in November 2012. Experts like McCarthy stress that other bullish market conditions contributed to those returns.\nThis next halving also arrives after a year of steep increases for bitcoin. As of Thursday afternoon, bitcoin stood at just over $63,500 per CoinMarketCap. That’s down from the all-time-high of about $73,750 hit last month, but still double the asset’s price from a year ago.\nMuch of the credit for bitcoin’s recent rally is given to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset — spot bitcoin ETFs, which were only approved by U.S. regulators in January. A research report from crypto fund manager Bitwise found that these spot ETFs, short for exchange-traded funds, saw $12.1 billion in inflows during the first quarter.\nBitwise senior crypto research analyst Ryan Rasmussen said persistent or growing ETF demand, when paired with the “supply shock” resulting from the coming halving, could help propel bitcoin’s price further.\n“We would expect the price of Bitcoin to have a strong performance over the next 12 months,” he said. Rasmussen notes that he’s seen some predict gains reaching as high as $400,000, but the more “consensus estimate” is closer to the $100,000-$175,000 range.\nOther experts stress caution, pointing to the possibility the gains have already been realized.\nIn a Wednesday research note, JPMorgan analysts maintained that they don’t expect to see post-halving price increases because the event “has already been already priced in” — noting that the market is still in overbought conditions per their analysis of bitcoin futures.\nWHAT ABOUT MINERS?\nMiners, meanwhile, will be challenged with compensating for the reduction in rewards while also keeping operating costs down.\n“Even if there’s a slight increase in bitcoin price, (halving) can really impact a miner’s ability to pay bills,” Andrew W. Balthazor, a Miami-based attorney who specializes in digital assets at Holland & Knight, said. “You can’t assume that bitcoin is just going to go to the moon. As your business model, you have to plan for extreme volatility.”\nBetter-prepared miners have likely laid the groundwork ahead of time, perhaps by increasing energy efficiency or raising new capital. But cracks may arise for less-efficient, struggling firms.\nOne likely outcome: Consolidation. That’s become increasingly common in the bitcoin mining industry, particularly following a major crypto crash in 2022.\nIn its recent research report, Bitwise found that total miner revenue slumped one month after each of the three previous halvings. But those figures had rebounded significantly after a full year — thanks to spikes in the price of bitcoin as well as larger miners expanding their operations.\nTime will tell how mining companies fare following this next looming halving. But Rasmussen is betting that big players will continue to expand and utilize the industry’s technology advances to make operations more efficient.\nWHAT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT?\nPinpointing definitive data on the environmental impacts directly tied to bitcoin halving is still a bit of a question mark. But it’s no secret that crypto mining consumes a lot of energy — and operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to emissions of burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that pushes towards the use of more clean energy have increased in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.\nStill, production pressures could result in miners turning to cheaper, less climate-friendly energy sources. And when looking towards the looming halving, JPMorgan cautioned that some bitcoin mining firms may also “look to diversify into low energy cost regions” to deploy inefficient mining rigs.","Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, underwent a programmed reduction in its new coin creation rate on April 19. This event, known as a \"halving,\" occurs roughly every four years and is designed to slow down the overall supply of Bitcoin as per CoinGecko.\nBitcoin’s dominance is currently 54.14 per cent, an increase of 0.12 per cent over the day, as per Coinmarketcap data.\nFollowing the halving, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable, experiencing a slight dip of 0.47 per cent to settle at  ₹58,89,117 on Wazirx.\nThe event was highly anticipated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe it will solidify Bitcoin's value as a scarce asset. Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, capped the total supply at 21 million coins.\nThe halving comes after a period of significant price fluctuations for Bitcoin. Bitcoin in March 2024, reached an all-time high of USD 73,803.25 but has since fallen back somewhat. The broader cryptocurrency market has also been buoyed by the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the expectation of lower interest rates.\nAndrew O'Neill, a crypto analyst at S&P Global, said he was “somewhat sceptical of the lessons that can be taken in terms of price prediction from previous halvings,” as quoted by Reuters.\n\"It's only one factor in a multitude of factors that can drive price,\" he said.\nAhead of the event, JPMorgan analysts expected Bitcoin's price to fall after halving as it was \"overbought\" amid tepid crypto funding, as quoted by Reuters.\n\"We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in,\" JP Morgan analysts wrote this week.\n\"The markets have priced in the halving, so there wasn’t any major volatility close to the event. But if you see yesterday’s stark contrast in Tech stock prices tanking but crypto prices moving higher; one can understand how crypto is decoupling itself as a new asset class, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures told Mint.\n“Broadly prices are lower from their recent highs due to geopolitical tensions, but we can expect near-term downward pressure as Miners and ecosystem participants adjust to the new supply dynamics. The 4th halving brings BTC’s annual inflation to less than gold’s and will further push investors to explore it as a ‘store of value’ asset class,” Chaturvedi added.\nBitcoin halving is a pre-destined event written into Bitcoin's code that happens roughly every four years. It cuts the reward miners get for verifying transactions in half, thereby slowing down the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This mimics scarcity in precious metals, potentially increasing Bitcoin's value over time as demand remains steady or rises.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The scheme impacted both investors trading and the exchange itself, which had to suspend operations after Eisenberg's attack made the exchange insolvent.\nNicole M. Argentieri, the principal deputy assistant attorney general who heads the DOJ's criminal division, said that Eisenberg's manipulative trading scheme \"puts our financial markets and investors at risk.\"\n\"This prosecution—the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency through open-market trades—demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to protecting US financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter what mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud,” Argentieri said.\nMango Labs has similarly sued Eisenberg over the price manipulation scheme, but that lawsuit was stayed until the DOJ's case was resolved. Mango Labs is expecting a status update today from the US government and is hoping to proceed with its lawsuit.\nArs could not immediately reach Mango Labs for comment.\nEisenberg's lawyer, Brian Klein, provided the same statement to Ars, confirming that Eisenberg's legal team is \"obviously disappointed\" but \"will keep fighting for our client.\"\nMango Labs has accused Eisenberg of being a \"notorious cryptocurrency market manipulator,\" noting in its complaint that he has a \"history of attacking multiple cryptocurrency platforms and manipulating cryptocurrency markets.\" That history includes allegedly embezzling $14 million in 2021 while Eisenberg was working as a developer for another decentralized marketplace called Fortress, Mango Labs' complaint said.\nEisenberg's attack on Mango Markets intended to grab tens of millions more than the alleged Fortress attack. When Eisenberg was first charged, the DOJ explained how his Mango Markets price manipulation scheme worked.\nOn Mango Markets, investors can \"purchase and borrow cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related financial products,\" including buying and selling \"perpetual futures contracts.\"\n\"When an investor buys or sells a perpetual for a particular cryptocurrency, the investor is not buying or selling that cryptocurrency but is, instead, buying or selling exposure to future movements in the value of that cryptocurrency relative to another cryptocurrency,\" the DOJ explained.\nUnderstanding this, Eisenberg opened separate accounts to either buy or sell perpetuals of a cryptocurrency called MNGO, then sold the perpetuals to himself while making a series of large MNGO purchases that drove up the cryptocurrency price. According to the SEC, Eisenberg \"controlled, sold, and contemporaneously purchased purported perpetual futures contracts with respect to approximately 488 million MNGO tokens (out of approximately 500 million tokens in circulation).\"\nBy purchasing so much of the otherwise \"thinly traded\" MNGO cryptocurrency, the SEC said, Eisenberg was able to artificially inflate the prices of both the cryptocurrency and the perpetuals, ultimately causing \"the price of MNGO Perpetuals on Mango Markets to rise approximately 1300 percent in a period of approximately 20 minutes.\" The price of MNGO was artificially raised by more than 2,200 percent at one point, the SEC claimed.\nOnce the value of the perpetuals was basically maxed out, Eisenberg then borrowed and withdrew \"approximately $110 million worth of various cryptocurrencies from Mango Markets, which came from deposits of other investors in the Mango Markets exchange,\" virtually wiping out the exchange while causing the price of MNGO perpetuals to \"collapse.\"\n\"Eisenberg withdrew nearly all then-available funds from Mango Markets,\" the DOJ said. \"When Eisenberg borrowed and withdrew this cryptocurrency, he had no intention of repaying the borrowed funds but rather intended to steal those funds.\"\nWhen Eisenberg first faced down lawsuits over the Mango Markets scheme—including complaints filed by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the SEC—he took to Twitter to defend his price manipulation as \"a highly profitable trading strategy.\"\nEisenberg has about 40,000 followers on Twitter (now known as X) but stopped tweeting in 2022. At that time, many Twitter users challenged the ethics of his tactics and advised him to lawyer up. One follower commented that \"rebranding market manipulation that resulted in a protocol’s insolvency as a 'highly profitable trading strategy' is a bold move. While Mango should have had more risk mitigation processes in place, coercing a $47 million bounty from the protocol seems less than ethical.\"\nBut Eisenberg claimed that he believed \"all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.\"\nMango Labs has complained that in these tweets, Eisenberg \"bragged about his attack\" while protecting his \"ill-gotten gains,\" only returning $67 million to the platform after forcing it \"under duress\" into \"an unenforceable settlement agreement.\" Through that since-discarded agreement, Mango Labs had to agree not to pursue charges against Eisenberg.\nIn tweets, Eisenberg claimed that the settlement agreement was intended to make \"all users whole as soon as possible.\"\nAn assistant attorney general, Kenneth A. Polite, Jr., confirmed that the DOJ would continue to crack down on cryptocurrency schemes, apparently now including a strategy to nab offenders behind market-manipulation schemes. Eisenberg's conviction follows high-profile recent convictions and arrests of other accused crypto scammers, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Do Kwon.\n\"Exploiting decentralized finance platforms is the new frontier of old school financial crimes in which criminals abuse emerging technologies for their own personal gain,\" Polite said in a DOJ press release. \"With this prosecution, the Criminal Division is sending the message that no matter the mechanism used to commit market manipulation and fraud, we will work to hold those responsible to account.”\nListing image:\n    \n      apomares | E+","This article originally appeared on Quartz.\nAfter days of tumultuous trading, Bitcoin finally returned to above the $65,000-level Friday morning, thanks to its big “halving” event.

The result is a slowing supply of bitcoin into the market.\nIn prior bitcoin cycles, the halving preceded a bull run for the cryptocurrency.\nCrypto prices were impacted by Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel last weekend.

We can see similar bearish sentiments across miners' behavior, trading volumes, ETF flows and the news coming out of US inflation data,\" analysts at cryptocurrency bank Amina said in a research note Friday.\nAmina analysts said miners are selling their bitcoin ahead of the halving. Since halving reduces their rewards, there may be some operations that become unprofitable. So miners are looking to shore up their balance sheets.\n\"Currently, miner balances are near an all-time low. This comes at the back of heavy selling from miners as they scramble to take profits ahead of the halving,\" Amina said in the note.\nNet flows through the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have been negative since last week, according to Amina analysts — which is putting further pressure on bitcoin.\nIt has been another strong year for bitcoin, whose price is up 50%. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $73,000 in March.\nThe bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which were approved in the U.S. earlier this year, drove much of the gains last year and into 2024.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nLONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Bitcoin's long-anticipated 'halving' is, depending on where you sit, a vital event that will burnish the cryptocurrency's value as an increasingly scarce commodity, or little more than a technical change talked up by speculators to inflate its price. The halving comes after bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,803.25 in March.\nBut what exactly is the halving, and does it really matter?\nWHAT IS IT? The halving, which happens roughly every four years, the latest of which is expected this week, is a change in bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology designed to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are created.\nBitcoin was designed from its inception by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto to have a capped supply of 21 million tokens.\nNakamoto wrote the halving into bitcoin's code and it works by reducing the rate at which new bitcoin are released into circulation.\nSo far, about 19 million tokens have been released.\nHOW DOES IT HAPPEN?\nBlockchain technology involves creating records of information - called 'blocks' - which are added to the chain in a process called 'mining'.\nMiners use computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles to build the blockchain and earn rewards in the form of new bitcoin.\nThe blockchain is designed so that a halving occurs every time 210,000 blocks are added to the chain, roughly every four years.\nAt the halving, the amount of bitcoin available as rewards for miners is cut in half. This makes mining less profitable and slows the production of new bitcoins.\n(For a visual explanation of how blockchain works,\nclick here\n.)\nWHAT HAS IT GOT TO DO WITH BITCOIN'S PRICE?\nSome bitcoin enthusiasts say that bitcoin's scarcity gives it value.\nThe lower the supply of a commodity, all other things being equal, the price should rise when people try and buy more. Bitcoin is no different, they argue.\nOthers dispute the logic, noting that any impact would have already been factored in to the price.\nThe supply of bitcoin to the market is also largely down to crypto miners but the sector is opaque, with data on inventories and supplies scarce. If miners sell their reserves, that could pressure prices lower.\nSince hitting record highs last month, bitcoin's price has sunk below $64,000. JP Morgan analysts said this week they expect the price to fall further after the halving.\nEstablishing the reasons for a crypto rally is also hard, not least as there is far less transparency than in other markets.\nThe most common reason given for this year's surge is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's January approval of bitcoin ETFs, and expectations that central banks will cut interest rates.\nBut in the speculative world of crypto trading, explanations for price changes can snowball into market narratives that become self-fulfilling.\nWHAT ABOUT PREVIOUS HALVINGS?\nThere's no evidence to suggest that previous halvings have been behind bitcoin's subsequent price rises.\nStill, traders and miners have studied past halvings to try and gain an edge.\nWhen the last halving happened on May 11, 2020, the price rose around 12% in the following week and 659% in the following 12 months.\nBut there were many explanations for the rally - including loose monetary policy and stay-at-home retail investors with spare cash - and no real evidence the halving was behind it.\nAn earlier halving occurred in July 2016. Bitcoin rose around 1.3% in the following week, before plunging a few weeks later and then rallying.\nIn short: it's hard to isolate the impact, if any, halvings may have had previously or predict what could happen this time around. Regulators have repeatedly warned that bitcoin is a speculative market driven by hype and one that poses harm to investors.\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft and Tommy Reggiori Wilkes; Editing by Toby Chopra)","Process has coincided with a rise in price in the past and is due to take place again on Saturday\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, still has an influence on the cryptocurrency nearly 14 years after disappearing.\nThis week the protocol designed by Nakamoto – an individual or group of individuals who went silent in December 2010 – will trigger what is known as a “bitcoin halving”, a process that has coincided with price increases in the past. The latest halving is expected to take place on Saturday.\nHere we explain what the bitcoin halving entails and its potential impact.\nIt is related to how bitcoins are recorded and created. Transactions in the cryptocurrency are recorded on a universally accessible ledger called a blockchain. These transactions are put on the blockchain by “miners” who pack them into blocks that are then linked – or “chained” – together. They do this by solving a cryptographic puzzle using specialised hardware and – this is the key bit – receive a reward in newly created bitcoins.\nNakamoto intended the number of bitcoins entering circulation to be finite, at 21m, so the protocol seeks to control the amount of new coins entering the market. It does this by halving the size of the miners’ reward every 210,000 blocks – roughly every four years.\nThe latest halving is expected to take place in the early hours of Saturday in the US and UK, when the reward for adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain will decrease from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. Bitcoin – of which there are more than 19m in circulation – will continue to halve until the 21m point is reached, expected in 2140.\nHalving reduces the supply of new bitcoins, which should in theory increase the price. It is an economic axiom that if demand for an asset remains stable while its supply decreases, its price should go up.\nThe past three halvings – in 2020, 2016 and 2012 – have resulted in an average price increase of 16% over the 60 days that followed, according to data from the asset research firm 10x Research. The 2016 halving resulted in a decrease of 6% over the following 60 days, although it then rallied strongly throughout 2017.\nMarkus Thielen, the head of research at 10x, says the halving is “associated with price increases due to reduced supply” but investors will have to wait for a price peak, which typically comes 500 days after a halving.\nIn recent weeks bitcoin has fallen sharply from a recent record high of more than $70,000 (£56,175) to about $62,000 but it remains a strongly performing asset, up 40% so far in 2024 and more than double where it was at the same time last year.\nIt is worth noting that while prices ultimately rose after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, they underwent prolonged dips – so-called “crypto winters” in 2018 and 2022 where prices underwent a prolonged dip.\n“The setup feels really familiar to past occasions where there has been a very sharp rally and it forms a top … then breaks,” says Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto. Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote on Thursday that the halving was “already partially priced in by the market” and that they did “not expect prices to increase significantly following the halving event”.\nBitcoin mining companies, which take on the energy and equipment costs of validating transactions, face a financial hit as their reward drops.\nafter newsletter promotion\nAndrew O’Neill, the managing director of the digital assets research lab at the credit ratings firm S&P Global, wrote this week: “The block reward remains a significant part of miners’ revenue, therefore halving the reward impacts profitability.”\nHe added: “Some operations will become non-profitable and will shut down as result, particularly those with higher energy costs.”\nTo make bitcoin mining financially sustainable, S&P says, the currency will need to be used more widely throughout the global economy in order to increase miners’ revenues via transaction fees. However, greater use of the cryptocurrency jars with concerns that energy-intensive bitcoin mining is already environmentally unsustainable.\nThere is also, for bitcoin’s many critics, the negative impact of amateur investors being lured in by any price rise – and hype – that follows the halving.\nBitcoin has gained in legitimacy this year, increasing its price, with US Securities and Exchange Commission permitting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – that track the price of the cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, was begrudging in giving the go-ahead, describing bitcoin as a volatile asset used for “illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing”.\nO’Neill is also sceptical that there will be a price boom. “The BTC [bitcoin] market is in a very different place to when the prior halvings occurred four, eight and 12 years ago,” he says. “Other drivers such as the growth of BTC ETFs in the US, and macro drivers such as interest rates and market liquidity, will also influence price.”\nCarol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex business school, says any price boost from the halving will ultimately be illusory.\n“It will probably go above the all-time high but in the long run its value will be zero because there is no intrinsic value in bitcoin whatsoever,” she says. “It’s simply a speculative asset.”","The long-awaited bitcoin halving bell is here, but don't bet on more rapid gains just yet —  JPMorgan says the price of the world's largest crypto could tumble shortly after the event.\nThe quadrennial halving — scheduled around April 19-20 — slashes the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation by reducing the amount rewarded to miners by half. The market has widely been anticipating the event as a bullish catalyst, helping to send the token to record highs in 2024.\n\"We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in. In fact we see downside for the bitcoin price post halving for several reasons.\" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this week.\nFirst, JPMorgan says that the bitcoin market is still riding high in overbought territory after surging to record highs in March. Panigirtzoglou previously pointed out several indicators that confirm this.\n\"There remains considerable optimism in the market over the prospect for prices rising significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from a view that bitcoin demand via spot ETFs would continue at the same pace even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes after the halving event,\" he said in a separate note at the end of March.\nJPMorgan also observes that venture capital funding remains low despite the recent revival in the crypto market, another headwind for the price.\n\"We had previously argued that a recovery in crypto VC flows is a necessary condition for a sustained recovery in crypto markets so in our mind the subdued VC flows YTD pose a downside risk,\" the bank said in a note earlier this month.\nMining companies will take a hit after the halving, the analysts said, while some could relocate to improve efficiency as they face the prospect of lower rewards. Others may consolidate and combine with larger publicly listed miners.\n\"Post halving event, it is also likely that some bitcoin mining firms may look to diversify into low energy cost regions such as Latin America or Africa to deploy their inefficient mining rigs to gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle,\" the analysts wrote.\nGet the latest Gold price here."]}

Their goal was to spend a week hacking to prepare for the so-called bitcoin halving — an event that is baked into the chain's code and helps to stave off inflation through programmatic monetary policy.\nA lot of the talk surrounding the halving, which happens roughly every four years, has been pegged to the fact that new issuance of the world's largest virtual coin would be cut in half. But the block that locked in the halving also coincided with a couple other major launches on the blockchain, including cutting-edge programming innovations that are expected to draw both a lot more coders and a lot more venture capital dollars into the bitcoin ecosystem.\nAlso unlike past halving events, the world's largest cryptocurrency touched a new all-time high above $73,000 in March as record flows entered the bitcoin ecosystem via the newly-launched spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S.\n\"Bitcoin has never been healthier – what was missing previously was a vibrant developer ecosystem on top,\" said Magic Eden's co-founder and chief operating officer, Zedd Yin.\nMagic Eden's pop-up hacker house was modest but had a few bells and whistles that carried the skeleton crew through the week.\nThose perks included Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter themed arcade-style machine games in the living room — plus a DIY open bar on a collapsible, plastic table in the dining room.\nEngineers also went into the hackathon with the distinct advantage of knowing what they wanted to build. In the days leading up to the halving, Yin, 33, convened his team under the same roof in Northern California with one clear goal in mind: To code and launch the definitive marketplace for a new wave of digital products coming to bitcoin's blockchain. On Monday morning, Magic Eden's Runes Platform went live, helping to cement its place as the go-to forum to deal in these novel bitcoin offerings.\nFor years, rival chains like ethereum and solana have competed with bitcoin on functionality, because both have smart contracts — that is, programmable pieces of code — natively built into the base chain. That has been one of the chief reasons why developers around the world have flocked to these blockchains to build applications.\nEnter Casey Rodarmor.\nThe popular bitcoin coder totally disrupted this dynamic last year when he introduced bitcoin's version of non-fungible tokens known as ordinals, which developers ended up using as a base for bitcoin-issued coins called BRC-20 tokens. The launch was quiet, at first, but ultimately landed him tremendous acclaim.\nLate Friday night, at the exact moment that the bitcoin halving initialized, Rodarmor unveiled his latest creation, runes, which is basically just a better and more efficient version of BRC-20 tokens.\n\"People really respect Casey and think that he sort of captured lightning in a bottle,\" said Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures. \"And so there's very high expectations for runes as well.\"\nTechnically speaking, runes just enables asset issuance of fungible tokens on bitcoin's base chain. That could be stablecoins, memecoins, or any variety of fungible token.\nThe reason this is significant to developers is because of its efficiency relative to existing BRC-20 tokens, bitcoin's widely-used fungible token standard that has already received a ton of traction. Having a universally accepted token standard like this is seen as key to helping unlock scale of decentralized finance on bitcoin. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a parallel banking system that cuts out middlemen like lawyers and banks and relies upon code for enforcement.\n\"Fungible tokens are a significant part of every meaningful ecosystem like solana and ethereum, so runes is an important step in the evolution of bitcoin,\" said Yin, who previously helped lead product for all institutional trading products at Coinbase.\nBill Barhydt, who runs Abra, a company that supports miners with a mix of services, including auto liquidations, and has access to macro data across the sector, said bitcoin simply cannot scale 100% on-chain via its own layer one. The problem has to do with the fact that bitcoin's blockchain lacks the built-in smart contract capabilities necessary to reproduce the banking stack of a chain like ethereum or solana.\n\"BRC-20 tokens and ordinals, its successor runes, sidechains such as stacks, and DeFi on bitcoin are all showing strong promise in user adoption which stands to dramatically increase the demand for bitcoin block space and adoption, which I believe will create a positive feedback loop further driving bitcoin price gains in the coming years,\" Barhydt said. \"It's truly remarkable the level of new development work happening around bitcoin,\" he added.\nVenture investors agree.\n\"I've never seen deal pacing move this aggressively in the bitcoin space in my entire career,\" Carter tells CNBC.\nIndeed, the VC appetite for these layer two bitcoin projects has been picking up in the last few months.\nPitchBook says that the fourth quarter of 2023 was the first time in almost two years that deal value in the crypto sector had increased, reaching $1.9 billion — up 2.5% from the previous quarter. While still well off the 2021 high of $31 billion, funds are building back interest, and trust, in the space.\n\"There's definitely been an awakening of capital interest in the bitcoin layer two space,\" said Muneeb Ali, who co-founded Stacks — an open-source blockchain network that brings smart contracts to bitcoin.\nStacks is a separate chain to bitcoin but the two are able to work together. The project launched its own upgrade at the time of the halving block, as well, which reduced transaction time to five seconds, compared to the 10 to 30 minute block times tied to bitcoin's base chain.\n\"Having so much VC interest just cements that the bitcoin ecosystem is primed to grow,\" Ali said, who noted that the pace of projects launching on bitcoin has also picked up momentum in the last six months, from a half dozen projects going live to more than 50.\nA new report released by Austin-based venture fund Trammell Venture Partners found that the bitcoin startup sector had a breakout year at the pre-seed stage, noting a 360% year-over-year increase in transaction count.\n\"Founders really want to be building on bitcoin specifically,\" Christopher Calicott, the fund's managing director and founding partner, said of the study's findings.\nThe report also noted that early-stage, bitcoin-native startups raised just under $1 billion from 2021 through 2023.\nTake Alpen Labs. The layer two project, which is bringing cutting-edge scaling technology known as zero-knowledge proofs to bitcoin, just emerged from stealth mode with Ribbit Capital leading a $10.6 million round. Another popular layer two solution dubbed \"Build on Bitcoin,\" or BOB, has raised $10 million in seed funding.\n\"Ordinals, BRC-20s and other innovations that came about in 2023 really helped build momentum ahead of the halving,\" Ali said. \"They made bitcoin fun again for developers and showed that users will favor NFTs, assets, and apps on bitcoin if given the opportunity.\"\nFor years, developers have been trying to bake additional functionality into bitcoin's base chain. Barhydt tells CNBC that demand for DeFi — specifically yield and lending — is a key driver of crypto adoption.\nSidechains like stacks, for example, have been working to bring the speed and competitive transaction costs of solana-type rails to the bitcoin ecosystem, in order to decongest the main chain and allow the overall bitcoin economy to scale.\nWith runes, these existing projects have a new tool they can use to grow, since it enables them to potentially plug into a native, lightweight token system on the main bitcoin chain rather than having to generate their own independent token environment.\n\"Runes presents an efficient system for creating and managing fungible tokens directly on bitcoin in a way that reduces blockchain bloat and improves scalability compared to other token standards,\" said Hong Fang, president of crypto exchange OKX. \"This has major implications for layer two solutions and sidechains that are working to scale bitcoin,\" added Fang, who previously spent nearly a decade working at Goldman Sachs.\nStacks's Ali has dubbed the post-halving environment \"bitcoin season two.\"\n\"Season two is all about the return of builders to bitcoin. Users are finally separating bitcoin the asset from Bitcoin, as the rails,\" he said.\nAs for Yin and his team — one other big takeaway of the runes hackathon was the need for a bit more due diligence on Airbnb properties.\nThe team had an outdoor gas fireplace that wasn't working so there was a constant smell of a gas leak the entire week, the rental's WiFi was down for the entire first day — and a handful of folks got Covid.",null,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nBlockchain stocks may be a better way to play the cryptocurrency market than directly engaging. These stocks are of companies that effectively integrate blockchain technology across multiple industries, offering a more diversified exposure to investors.  Moreover, you can also sidestep all the regulatory roadblocks, liquidity troubles, and tax implications that aren’t as clear with cryptocurrencies.\nAlso, the growing excitement around Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) upcoming halving event makes it an excellent time to gain exposure to the best blockchain stocks. Moreover, this sector will continue evolving and expanding at a breathtaking pace for the foreseeable future, making it appealing for those looking to supercharge their portfolios.\nFintech giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is looking to leverage the power of blockchain technology to usher in a new era of growth for its business. Through its strategic partnerships, the company is looking to redefine financial transactions through enhanced security and efficiency.

The flagship cryptocurrency was trading around $63,240 in mid-morning, with a drop of over 2.5%.\nThe price decline comes a week after the halving phase of Bitcoin, which split the reward for miners from 3.125 Bitcoin to 6.25. The top cryptocurrency was celebrating the post-halving phase earlier this week. Now, the crypto has lost nearly 10% of its value in a month.\nThe decline in Bitcoin’s price is mainly due to losses in major U.S. technology stocks, which were triggered by weak earnings reports from Meta and IBM. In the morning, Meta’s shares lost over 12%, while IBM’s fell more than 8%. Microsoft and Google parent company Alphabet are expected to release their earnings reports after Thursday’s market close. Their shares were down 4.4% and 2.5%, respectively, in mid-morning.\nIt is common for Bitcoin to follow the movement of U.S. tech stocks as both are seen as high-return investments and are associated with the development of future technologies. Moreover, Bitcoin and blockchain technology have become more mainstream due to the involvement of big companies such as BlackRock, as well as the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nThe bearish sentiment spread across the crypto market after Bitcoin’s price dropped, resulting in the global crypto market cap dropping by 2.16% to $2.35 trillion. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down by 2.6%, hovering around $3,100. Solana shed nearly 6%, trading around $145 in mid-morning. Top meme-coin Dogecoin lost 3.5% in its value, trading at $0.14, according to CoinMarketCap.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","This article was published more than 6 months ago. Some information may no longer be current.\nAn advertisement for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin displayed on a tram, May 12, 2021, in Hong Kong.Kin Cheung\/The Associated Press\nIn March, bitcoin hit an historic high, reaching a price of more than US$73,000. Its skyrocketing value and increasing popularity attracted many budding investors interested in getting into cryptocurrency. But unless those new investors have tens of thousands of dollars available, it’s likely they’d only buy a fraction of a bitcoin, which is available to buy through a cryptocurrency exchange or some online stock services.\nThanks to its now-exorbitant price, purchasing and owning fractions of one bitcoin is becoming the norm, just as the global supply of available bitcoin has almost reached its limit.\nOn April 20, bitcoin investors and crypto companies were gearing up for what’s called the halving, an event that happens every four years that could have potential ripple effects across the industry. But what is the halving event, and what actually happened? Here’s what to know:\nBitcoin halving is designed to consistently reduce the rate at which new coins are introduced. Bitcoin’s maximum supply of tokens is capped at 21 million, and more than 19 million are already in circulation, which means the supply is quickly reaching its limit.\nBy halving the amount of coins that enter circulation at a time, the goal is to never reach the 21 million limit – or at least slow it down.\nTo extract a bitcoin from the blockchain, which is essentially a public ledger that tracks cryptocurrency transactions, miners race against each other to solve complex algorithms. When someone manages to solve that algorithm, they are rewarded with a set number of bitcoins.\nThe computational power needed to mine a single bitcoin, which is called its hashrate, has been steadily increasing for months. That means the amount of energy required to mine bitcoin is going up, and it’s getting more expensive. Every time bitcoin is halved, it becomes less profitable to mine, which can potentially hurt large mining operations.\nEvery four years, starting in 2012, the amount of bitcoin distributed when mining is reduced by half. The first bitcoin halving happened on Nov. 28, 2012 – after three subsequent halvings in 2016, 2020 and now April, 2024, miners can extract only 3.125 bitcoins after solving the algorithm. The next halving, in 2028, will reduce this even further to 1.625.\nWhenever a halving occurred, the price of bitcoin spiked – a year after the May, 2020, bitcoin halving, bitcoin was up more than 545 per cent. Though some said that increase was heightened owing to increased attention during the pandemic.\nAnalysts and investors hoped that bitcoin’s price would rise once again. The more scarce bitcoin becomes after each halving, they believe, the more valuable it becomes.\nIn an April 8 report, analysts from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex predicted bitcoin’s price would soar about 160 per cent in the 12 to 14 months after this year’s halving, which they said could push bitcoin to a new high of more than US$150,000.\nBut other analysts believed that the halving was already a factor in bitcoin’s price increase in March – when it hit the mark of US$73,803.25 – and no further increase would happen.\nSince the halving on April 20, there hasn’t been a big impact on the price of bitcoin. As of April 24, the price was sitting at around US$64,500.\nAnalysts say that bitcoin has increasingly been trading like a regular stock, and is now more susceptible to react normally to market forces – such as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran – rather than individual traders buying or selling the cryptocurrency.\nEven though there hasn’t been an immediate impact, some believe that the halving could be the first step in a potential increase in bitcoin’s price within the next year.\nWith a report from Reuters.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nEditorial code of conduct\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.","25th Apr, 2024. 06:55 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 17603955.19 on 25 April 2024.\n1 BTC =  17603955.19 Pakistani rupees.\nDisclaimer: All data and information are provided for informational purposes only.

Some information may no longer be current.\nHi, I’m Samantha Edwards, an editor at The Globe and Mail. Welcome back to Lately, The Globe’s new tech newsletter where every Friday morning I break down the week’s biggest tech stories and how they intersect with – and even change – our world.\n⏲️ The U.S. has started the clock for a potential TikTok ban. What does that mean for Canada?\n💸 A glimpse into the inner workings of a crypto scam\n🤖 Canada’s screenwriters say: No robots in the writers’ room\n⚡ When Zoom layoffs go viral\nByteDance has nine months to sell TikTok to an American entity, or face a ban in the U.S.Dado Ruvic\/Reuters\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden gave TikTok’s owner ByteDance an ultimatum: Either sell the platform to an American company within nine months – or get banned in the U.S. Lawmakers say TikTok is a threat to national security, arguing ByteDance, a Chinese company, could use the app to spread propaganda or access sensitive data. TikTok chief executive officer Shou Chew said the company will file a court challenge.\nA few people have signalled interest in purchasing TikTok, which is valued at more than $50-billion. They include Donald Trump’s former treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, Canadian businessman and Shark Tank judge Kevin O’Leary, and Chris Pavlovski, CEO of the MAGA crowd’s preferred YouTube alternative Rumble.\nIn Canada, Ottawa ordered a national security review of TikTok last September and the app has been banned from federal government devices. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hasn’t commented on the U.S. bill yet, but it’s likely that Canada will follow the lead of the Americans, says Philip Mai, co-director of the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University. For now, even if TikTok was banned in the U.S., it would still be available in Canadian app stores.\nIn the next few weeks, we’ll see how Beijing responds. Mai says the Chinese government could put a ban on ByteDance selling certain technologies, i.e. the sale of TikTok could go through, but not its secret-sauce algorithm. However, a sale without the algorithm would drastically lower TikTok’s value.\n“More than likely, Beijing will make some noise – it’s unfair, it’s illegal – but in the end, they’ll let it go because if they don’t, they’ll be hurting their own people because now the value of the asset they have will go down,” Mai says.\nCourt documents provide a glimpse into a crypto scam.Dado Ruvic\/Reuters\nIn 2019, Gerald Cotten, the young co-founder of Canada’s largest virtual currency exchange QuadrigaCX, died while on his honeymoon at the age of 30. After his death, the exchange collapsed into bankruptcy and thousands of users were unable to access their money.\nNow new court documents filed in the B.C. Supreme Court provide the first glimpse into how the Quadriga crypto scam unfolded. The documents include chat transcripts from 2014 between Cotten and QuadrigaCX’s other co-founder, Michael Patryn, discussing how they could squeeze the most money out of their new company, taking it public in a “pump-and-dump” scheme or using proceeds to “look at scam opportunities.”\nReflecting on his own ownership stakes in Quadriga, Cotten wrote to Patyrn about his own saintly ambitions: “I want to be like bitcoin jesus, but better lol.”\nMembers of the Writers Guild of Canada rally in support of U.S. screenwriters in June, 2024.Tijana Martin\/The Canadian Press\nLast week I wrote about the six months of negotiations between the Writers Guild of Canada and the Canadian Media Producers Association, with AI protections and greater pay being the major sticking points. On Thursday, the WGC announced that 96.5 per cent of its voting members were in favour of authorizing a strike. The guild said it would not immediately strike, but would use the results as a bargaining tool.\nLayoffs should be like break ups: always in person.Sam Wasson\/Getty Images\nYou’ve probably seen Get Ready With Me videos on TikTok, where a person does their makeup, chooses an outfit or perhaps whips up a photogenic matcha latte. Now a new twist on this style of post is popping up: Get Ready With Me to Get Laid Off. As layoffs over Zoom become more common – the telltale warning sign being an out-of-the-blue calendar invite with HR – some people are filming the hours leading up to their layoffs, and sometimes even the deed itself. On today’s episode of Lately, host Vass Bednar speaks with Amanda Hoover, a staff writer at Wired, about the reality of remote layoffs and what happens when they go viral.\nHow Montreal’s RodeoFX clawed its way to the top of the visual-effects business (Report on Business Magazine)\nWhat happens after your country runs on 99 per cent renewable electricity?  (The Verge)\nOld Macdonald had a drone. Inside farming’s tech boom (The Walrus)\n$169.95 is a ridiculous amount. And yet, this mug has made my life a lot better.Supplied\nIn my previous two Adult Money columns, I wrote about aspirational items I thought would make me feel more like an Adult – a chic work tote bag, a walking pad desk set-up – and consequently catapult me into new wild heights of success. Reader, I’m sorry to report I haven’t purchased either yet. I’m just not a big online shopper. I’m more of an “add a half dozen things to my shopping cart and forget about it until I start getting targeted ads on The Globe’s website” type of person.\nHowever, this week I’m here to talk about something that has actually made my life better. Last year for my birthday, my brother who works in the startup world (the truest tech bro, if you will) gifted me an Ember temperature-controlled mug, which has a built-in heater that keeps your coffee piping hot for up to 1.5 hours. The 10-ounce mug is not cheap. Right now it retails for $169.95, which is a ridiculous amount. But as a slow drinker, it has significantly improved my morning routine.\nBrian Eno gets the AI treatment\nNo two screenings of Eno will be the same.Supplied\nBrian Eno is a glam rock pioneer, the legendary producer of David Bowie and Talking Heads, and the godfather of ambient music. Eno’s sparse music was my go-to soundtrack for late-night studying and stress writing on deadline.

The U.S. has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022.\nNow the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for \"powering\" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia. This is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation.\nAs China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters. Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.\n\"You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,\" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business. GOING 'UNDERGROUND'\nA manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible U.S. sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said. A banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. \"The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,\" said the banker, who asked not to be named.\nSince last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by U.S. sanctions, the sources said. \"Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,\" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. \"But these methods carry significant risks.\"\nMaking payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as \"it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small\". The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.\nChina's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\". The People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nSANCTIONS WARNING U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\".\nStill, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year. While officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\" A State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.\n\"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said. Blinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\"\nNearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong. Some of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.\nAmong the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings. By contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.\n'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT' The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.\nSome rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts. A chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.\nCalls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered. BOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.\nThe manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia. \"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\"\nWang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business. \"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said.\n\"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.\"\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025"]}

Zhao pleaded guilty late last year to money-laundering violations and stepped down as CEO of Binance. The company itself was fined $4.3bn. Zhao was fined $50m last year.\nJudge Richard Jones told Zhao that there were a number of mitigating factors in his sentencing, including that he had cooperated with law enforcement. Jones also cited numerous letters the court had received that testified to Zhao’s character, and stated that he did not believe Zhao was likely to reoffend.\nThe Department of Justice sought a 36-month sentence for Zhao in a filing last week, arguing that he “violated US law on an unprecedented scale” and that his “sentence should reflect the gravity of his crimes”. Zhao’s defense lawyers argued that he should receive only probation.\n“Mr Zhao deeply regrets his offense, and he has shown exceptional acceptance of responsibility and remediation,” Zhao’s lawyers said in their filing before the sentencing.\nZhao, who goes by CZ, has for years been one of the biggest names in cryptocurrency. He amassed billions of dollars as head of Binance, founding the exchange in 2017 and growing it into a dominant industry player as crypto investments surged. Zhao’s downfall coincided with a broader legal scrutiny of the crypto industry, including his fellow billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried being sentenced to 25 years in prison this year for financial fraud.\nThe justice department’s case against Zhao revolved around his failure to comply with US anti-money-laundering laws and to file proper reports with government agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. In practice, prosecutors say that led to Binance becoming a hub for illicit financial transactions that included extremist groups, criminals and people trafficking child sexual abuse materials.\nBinance failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions to law enforcement, prosecutors alleged, including those involving US-designated terror groups such as al-Qaida, Islamic State and Hamas.\n“From the very beginning, Zhao and other Binance executives had engaged in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing the controls that are required by US law,” the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said after Zhao pleaded guilty.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, the probation department recommended that Zhao receive five months in prison. They emphasized trying to find a balance between a deterrent and something that would not be unusually harsh. Zhao’s lawyers argued that the government seeking three years in prison was out of step with similar cases where defendants received no jail time.\nZhao issued a short statement during the hearing, telling the judge that he wanted to focus his efforts on an online education platform and that he had reflected on his actions.\nafter newsletter promotion\nZhao remained active in the lead-up to the sentencing, traveling around the country and once meeting with Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO. Earlier this year, he announced to his nearly 9 million followers on the social media platform X that he was starting an online education program, an effort that he brought up again in his remarks at the hearing.\nIn addition to the sentence, Zhao’s plea deal requires him to pay $50m personally and Binance to pay $4.3bn in fines. The deal also carries potential US immigration implications for Zhao, who is a Canadian and Emirati citizen, but who is known for frequently moving between cities.\nProsecutors argued following his plea deal that Zhao was a flight risk due to his immense wealth, and a judge ruled that he had to remain in the US awaiting sentencing. Jones stated in the sentencing hearing that Zhao should understand that wealth and power do not make a person immune from legal consequences, adding that Binance had turned a blind eye to criminal activity on its platform.\nFew within crypto ever approached Zhao’s status within the industry. While Zhao’s former rival Bankman-Fried became a public face and courted politicians in Washington, Zhao’s wealth and influence over crypto far surpassed him. Binance also played an important role in the downfall of Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, after Zhao’s decision in 2022 to liquidate Binance’s holdings of FTX’s own cryptocurrency accelerated investor concerns and hastened the rival exchange’s implosion.",null,"30th Apr, 2024. 04:36 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 10, 2024\nAs of April 30, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $61283.10.

It is real. You may not want to believe it, but I place a 25% chance that Bitcoin has already topped for this cycle,\" Brandt wrote in a note recently.\nHe added that he expects a plummet back to the 2021 lows in the mid-$30,000 range, which would mark a drop of roughly 50% from the current level.\nBrandt backed up his rationale with a concept he refers to as \"exponential decay,\" with each bull cycle of bitcoin from 2009 to 2021 shrinking by about 20% compared to the last.\nApplied to the latest rally, exponential decay says the current bullish trend might increase about 4.5 times the growth seen in the previous cycle from 2018-2021.\nGiven that framework, the high for this cycle was projected to be $72,723, a milestone that the world's largest cryptocurrency surpassed in March and which may prove that the bitcoin bull run is over for now.\n\"The fact is that the bull market cycles in Bitcoin have lost a tremendous amount of thrust over the years,\" he said.\nYet, Brandt notes that it might not be all that bad if bitcoin lost steam after such precipitous gains, pointing to similar moves in gold, which hit a low in late 2022 after a period of big gains, before rallying sharply to new highs this year.\n\"From a classical charting point of view, such a decline is the most bullish thing that could happen from a long-term view. If you want to see an example of such a chart structure, look at the Gold chart from Aug 2020 to Mar 2024,\" he wrote.\nAfter skyrocketing to $73,835 in mid-March, the token has stumbled. The bitcoin halving, which took place this month and which has been widely anticipated as a bullish catalyst, has failed to push the token meaningfully higher so far. Prices have stumbled further on renewed fears of hawkish monetary policy in recent weeks as inflation remains stubbornly high.\nBitcoin was trading around $62,955 on Tuesday, down by about 15% from the record high reached in March.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}
