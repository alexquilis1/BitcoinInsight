He added, \"Let's say 50%... that would be $8 billion coming into crypto in the first two weeks of December.\"\nKellam went on to discuss promising signs from major corporations, such as Microsoft’s recent proposal to allocate a portion of its $75 billion in cash to bitcoin. The company has advised against it in the upcoming shareholder vote.\nHe noted that upcoming fair value accounting rules will further facilitate crypto adoption by allowing companies to hold bitcoin without penalizing their balance sheets. \"All that's going away,\" he stated, emphasizing the importance of this change in making bitcoin a more viable asset for institutional balance sheets.\nAlthough optimistic about the future, Kellam advised caution, underscoring the importance of risk management in an unpredictable market. \"This is the most anticipated bull breakout ever… but we do have some potential for a major washout,\" he cautioned, reminding investors to stay vigilant.","Investors have plowed money into funds tracking bitcoin, betting on a return of Republican Donald Trump to the White House even as they expect wild price swings in the world’s largest cryptocurrency during the election week, data showed.\nExchange-traded funds (ETF) tracking the spot price of bitcoin notched net inflows of $917.2 million on Wednesday, the biggest one-day increase since March, according to the Block, a data and news provider.\nBlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the largest spot bitcoin fund by assets under management, pulled in $872 million in net flows, the largest one-day haul since its launch in January.\nBitcoin soared around 12% in October in anticipation of a second presidential term for Trump, who has styled himself as a pro-crypto candidate.\n“The rising odds of a Republican sweep (has) fueled optimism for potential crypto-friendly legislation in Congress post-election,” analysts at Ryze Labs said.\nPolls show Trump in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Kamala Harris, though betting sites such as Polymarket are pricing in much greater odds of a Trump victory.\nGiven the uncertainty, futures markets show investors are bracing for a volatile election week.

The race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is too close to call in the final days before the vote.\nBond yields have been rising since the Fed cut rates in September, leading investors to pull back on some futures positions and add tail-risk hedges on higher rates. For the most part, currency traders are betting on wider swings, with volatility for the yuan, Mexican peso and euro increasing on uncertainty about trade and tariffs. The Cboe Volatility Index slipped climbed 2.2% as of 10:29 a.m. in London on Monday.\nBecome a business insider with the latest news.\nOr with:\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n“Positioning is pretty clean” after some general de-risking the past few weeks into the election and Fed meeting, said Stuart Kaiser, a US equity trading strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. “That is good for risk\/reward post election depending on result of course. Bonds seem to be moving more than stocks.”\nHere’s a look at how options traders are positioning across various asset classes, from equities to crypto:\nAs expected, much of the hedging for the election has showed up at the last minute, as shorter-term options make it easier to position closer to an event. Implied volatility is running well above realized levels, with investors bracing for wider swings even as the S&P 500 Index went 29 sessions without a drop of more than 1%.\n“We continue to see an interest in trades around the election with a pick up in recent days,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler & Co. “Clients who expect Donald Trump to win the election are adding exposure to financials and crypto stocks, those who are betting on a Harris win buy options on renewable-energy stocks. There’s also a pick up in hedging with traders piling into put options for the S&P 500 and QQQ ETF.”\nShorter-term S&P 500 implied volatility has been running hot relative to one-month levels, as the election and Fed bump percolates through the calculation of the shorter-term measure. The Cboe VVIX Index — which measures the volatility of the VIX — is also elevated.\n“Currently, the options skew is steep and VIX is much higher than realized volatility,” said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “These are signs that the market is well hedged at this point.”\nWhile volatility has been elevated, it’s pointing to about a 1.7% move for the S&P 500 the day after the election — not an outrageous swing. The implied move has fallen steadily from a peak of around 2% in early October to be about in line with the long-term average for past elections, according to Stefano Pascale, head of US equity-derivatives strategy at Barclays Plc.\nBeyond the general indexes, some sectors, such as crypto and clean-energy stocks, are seeing a surge in volatility well above their medians. Crypto stocks are pricing almost 10% moves, Morgan Stanley’s trading desk said last week, and those for renewable firms around 6%. That’s playing out in positioning, where, for example, more than 20,000 November call spreads were bought last week in Sunrun Inc.\nOnce past the election, fundamental market flows are building up support for a rally into the end of the year, as hedges are taken off, mutual fund buying kicks in during November, companies repurchase shares and lower volatility draws in systemic buying and rehedging by option dealers.\n“Assuming a smooth post-election period, we believe these hedges may unwind and we could see a sharp drop of VIX and flatter skew,” said Ren. “If both happen, it could force more buyers into the market and push the market higher.”\nShort-term currency options that are now pricing in risk around the election have seen an implied volatility jump in anticipation of wider swings after the U.S. vote. One-week dollar-yuan swings hit a record high late last week as traders hedged against the possibility of higher U.S. tariffs that Trump has threatened and a global trade war that could especially hurt China.\nVolatility in the euro — also vulnerable to any trade tariffs that a victory for Trump could entail — has risen the most since 2020, reaching its highest level since March 2023, while risk reversals remain bearish on the euro versus the dollar. One-week volatility on the peso has climbed to the highest in more than four years, and its premium to expected swings further out in time widened to the highest since Bloomberg began compiling data in 2007.\nPositioning in the Treasuries market over the past couple of weeks has been focused toward traders de-leveraging positions in futures, skewed toward long liquidations amid rising expectations of a post-election boost to fiscal stimulus, swelling the supply of Treasuries. The result has seen open interest, or the amount of positions held by traders, drop sharply in 10-year note futures since the start of October as yields have climbed.\nThe de-risking, or traders taking chips off the table, has also been reflected in the cash market, where the latest survey from JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows clients reducing both long and short positions, as neutrals rise. In the options market for Treasuries, tail-risk hedges sit at higher yields and a bigger bond market selloff versus current levels. The 109.50 December 10-year put is notably populated, equivalent to a yield of approximately 4.5% and around 25 basis points higher than current levels.\n“Election volatility premium is most pronounced in the bond market on long-end rates, which we believe reflects concerns over higher fiscal risks on a sweep outcome,” said Tanvir Sandhu, Bloomberg Intelligence’s chief global derivatives strategist. “The skew suggests demand for hedges using payer swaptions against a selloff in long-end rates.”\nCrypto traders are diverging on the election result, with the options market turning from aggressively bullish to a more hedge-focused approach. The implied volatility for short-term contracts such as the 14-day puts has risen significantly while calls with the same expiration remain stable, according to data compiled by crypto liquidity provider B2C2.\nWhile there is no clear directional bias with heightened volatility going into the election, increasing premium for calls across longer tenors and termed Bitcoin futures on CME point to a bullish outlook beyond the election, with more rate cuts and potential positive changes in crypto policies in sight next year.\nBinary options — in which a payout is triggered if a pair of conditions are met, such as a currency and a stock reaching pre-determined levels — tend to be a popular way to hedge possible outcomes around major events. Such trades have picked up going in the election, according to Esmail Afsah, a derivatives strategist at JPMorgan.\n“I suspect this is mainly because investors have firm views on how individual assets are likely to behave in the four key permeations of the US election,” Afsah said. “Using hybrid options and betting on the direction of two assets concurrently allows to increase leverage materially and thus improve odds, providing of course that assets do indeed behave as expected.”\nNatalia Kniazhevich, Vassilis Karamanis and Edward Bolingbroke for Bloomberg with assistance from David Pan, Christian Dass, Jessica Menton and Jan-Patrick Barnert.","President Donald Trump said this week Jerome Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.”\nSign up for the CEO Daily newsletter\nGet global perspectives and insights from CEOs on the biggest stories in business.\nThe U.S. economy is in chaos.

Among the losers the market sees the Mexican peso, renewable energy companies and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1,200 points, or 2.8% early Wednesday. The S&P 500 rose 2%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.9%. Investors expect Trump’s victory to lead to faster economic growth and more market-friendly policies. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the Truth Social platform, soared.\nStock prices, bond yields and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin surged in the US on Wednesday as voters returned former President Donald Trump to the White House and the Republican party gained control of the Senate. Many investors expect Trump's victory to lead to faster economic growth and more market-friendly policies.\nFutures for the S&P 500 gained 2.2% before the bell and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.2%. Nasdaq futures rose 1.6%. Futures tied to the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which tend to rely more heavily on the U.S. economy for their income, soared more than 6%.\nThe price of bitcoin jumped nearly 8% to a record $75,345 before falling back slightly. Trump pledged support for cryptocurrencies during the campaign. Shares of the crypto exchange Coinbase rose 13% in premarket and almost all cryptocurrencies surged higher, including dogecoin, which jumped 18%.\nBank stocks, which could benefit from less restrictive regulations, rose in premarket trading. JPMorgan, the world’s biggest bank by assets, gained nearly 7%. Capital One rose 11.3%.\nTesla, led by Trump supporter Elon Musk, jumped nearly 13%. The company’s size gives it a big advantage in the electric vehicle market if, as expected, Trump does away with rebates and tax incentives for EVs, says Dan Ives of Wedbush.\nShares of Tesla's competitors largely fell.\nTrump is likely to undo some of the Biden administration’s effort to fight climate change. Renewable energy stocks such as First Solar and Enphase are down by double-digits in premarket trading. First Solar has been a big beneficiary of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. “The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,” Peter Esho of Esho Capital said.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the former president’s Truth Social platform, spiked 36% overnight as it became increasingly evident that Trump was returning to the highest elected office in the U.S. Trump shares had tumbled 10.4% in after-hours trading Tuesday before many polls closed and the results of the election were still uncertain. The stock tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its prospects of turning a profit.\nIn midday European trading, Germany's DAX climbed 0.4%, while the CAC 40 in Paris advanced 0.9%. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1%.\nMarkets worldwide have been fixated on what the election will mean for U.S. economic, monetary and trade policy, as well as geopolitics. The House has not yet been decided and a split in Congress between political parties would complicate policymaking. A Trump White House is likely to have far reaching ramifications given his support for sharp increases in tariffs, especially on imports from China.\nRobert Halver, head of Capital Market Analysis at Baader Bank in Germany said that, “since Donald Trump stands for the economy, it can be assumed that stock markets around the world will go up. With one exception: China, because he will definitely impose tariffs at least on China. That will certainly make life difficult for the Chinese.” The dollar surged against both the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan, two key trading partners. It rose 154.40 against the yen.\n“Undoubtedly, we are seeing a clear consensus among investors that President Trump would herald higher Federal Reserve rates, weaker global growth and greater geopolitical uncertainty, all of which is bullish for the dollar,\" said Matthew Ryan, head of Market Strategy at the global financial services firm Ebury.\nThe broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, even if each party’s policies can help and hurt different industries’ profits.\nSince 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation’s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\nThe S&P 500 has risen nearly 70% since the 2020 election brought President Joe Biden into office. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.\nThe economy was a key issue for inflation-weary U.S. voters who chose Trump this time around, though mainstream economists have said Trump's policy proposals would make inflation worse.\nTrump has also vowed to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, darkening the outlook for Chinese exporters at a time when Beijing has relied heavily on ramping up manufacturing to try to revive its slowing economy.\nChinese markets have been among the most active in the region this week as leaders hold a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature.\nThe gathering is expected to deliver more moves to help spur faster economic growth and resolve mounting levels of local government debt. On Tuesday, upbeat comments by Premier Li Qiang about the potential for both fiscal and monetary policies helped lift share benchmarks in Hong Kong and Shanghai by more than 2%. Li also expressed confidence that China will attain its growth target of about 5% this year.\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index gained 2.6% to 39,480.67, while the Kospi in Seoul shed 0.9% to 2,553.90.\nAustralia’s S&P\/ASX 200 rose 0.8% to 8,199.50.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.2% to 20,538.38, ending a three-day rally, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election. The Hang Seng Tech Index slipped 2.5%, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower, to 3,383.81.\nUS benchmark crude oil lost $1.34 to $70.65 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gave up $1.34 to $74.19 per barrel.\nThe Euro fell to $1.0707.\n(With inputs from agency)","For months, cryptocurrency investors have been eagerly awaiting the presidential election, convinced that a victory for former President Donald Trump would be good for bitcoin.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has promoted himself as a crypto believer, raising hopes that a Republican victory Tuesday could send the prices of digital currencies soaring. Bitcoin surged to $73,000 late last month, close to its record, after an influential crypto-powered betting market gave Trump a 67% chance of winning the election.\nThe election results are poised to cause more volatility. Over the past week, bitcoin’s price fell 7% to roughly $68,000 as the betting odds shifted to give Trump a narrower lead over Vice President Kamala Harris. Many crypto investors are hoping the price could rebound this week.\n“We expect bitcoin to break all-time highs on a Trump win,” the investment management and research firm Bernstein said in a report Monday, predicting that the digital currency could rise as high as $80,000 or $90,000. But if Harris wins, the report said, bitcoin’s price could fall as low as $50,000.\nThe election Tuesday is easily the most important political event in crypto’s history. For the first time, the industry’s leading companies have mobilized to invest enormous sums, funding a network of super political action committees that have spent tens of millions of dollars in key congressional races. The results could determine whether crypto companies flourish in the United States, or end up decamping to other countries in the face of a regulatory crackdown in Washington.\nThe market for bitcoin and other digital assets is known for its rapid swings. Early this year, bitcoin’s price climbed after the federal government allowed traditional financial firms to offer a new investment vehicle directly tied to the bitcoin market. The new products, a type of exchange traded funds, were a hit on Wall Street and attracted billions of dollars. In March, bitcoin reached a record price of $73,750.07, according to CoinMarketCap, a website that tracks crypto prices.\nSince then, the 2024 U.S. election has emerged as a pivotal moment for crypto. The Biden administration has aggressively pursued crypto companies for violating federal securities rules, bringing lawsuits against the Coinbase exchange and other large U.S. firms. In response, much of the industry has thrown its support behind Trump.\nTrump was once a crypto skeptic who dismissed bitcoin as “a scam.” But as crypto companies began donating large sums to influence the election, he warmed to the industry, promising to end the government’s crackdown.\nThis summer, Trump spoke at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, and vowed to turn the United States into “the crypto capital of the planet.” He also started his own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, and aggressively promoted it on social media.\nIn the run-up to the election, a set of super PACs financed by the crypto industry has spent more than $100 million to influence congressional races across the country. The aim is to install the most pro-crypto Congress in history — legislators who would advance the industry’s agenda in Washington and stop the Securities and Exchange Commission from pursuing crypto companies.\nThe political spending appears to have influenced both parties. In recent days, Harris has made overtures to the crypto industry, suggesting that she would also adopt a softer approach to regulation.\nStill, Trump “is seen as the pro-crypto candidate,” the Bernstein analysts wrote, while Harris is expected to continue the “hawkish crypto stance” of the Biden administration.\nBe smart with your money.

Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation.\nThe S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.\nThe U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean.\n“The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,” Peter Esho of Esho Capital said.\nOf course, how much change Trump effects in his second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that’s still to be determined. That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday’s big knee-jerk movements.\nNevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump’s dramatic win. Among them:\nBank stocks, UP\nBank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.\nCrypto, UP\nTrump has pledged to make the country “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase’s 31.1% leap.\nTesla, UP\nMusk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president’s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, UP\nThe company behind Trump’s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump’s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.\nPrivate-prison operators, UP\nA Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation’s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.\nStocks of smaller companies, UP\nTrump’s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500’s gain.\nTreasury bond prices, DOWN\nInvestors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market.

Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation.\nThe S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years.

All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.\nThe U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945.

That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday’s big knee-jerk movements.\nNevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump’s dramatic win. Among them:\nBank stocks, UP\nBank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.\nCrypto, UP\nTrump has pledged to make the country “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase’s 31.1% leap.\nTesla, UP\nMusk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president’s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, UP\nThe company behind Trump’s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump’s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.\nPrivate-prison operators, UP\nA Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation’s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.\nStocks of smaller companies, UP\nTrump’s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500’s gain.\nTreasury bond prices, DOWN\nInvestors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market.

Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.\nCrypto, UP\nTrump has pledged to make the country “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase’s 31.1% leap.\nTesla, UP\nMusk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president’s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, UP\nThe company behind Trump’s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump’s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.\nPrivate-prison operators, UP\nA Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation’s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.\nStocks of smaller companies, UP\nTrump’s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500’s gain.\nTreasury bond prices, DOWN\nInvestors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It’s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%.\nInflation worries, UP\nInvestors also see Trump’s policies likely adding to future inflation, particularly tariffs, which can add costs to U.S. households’ bills.\n“Trump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner,” said Andrzej Skiba, head of BlueBay U.S. Fixed Income at RBC Global Asset Management. “We’re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year’s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts.”\nA drop-off in immigration could also mean a crunch of available workers for employers, which could force companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on inflation.\nExpectations for interest rate cuts, MUDDLED\nMuch of Wall Street’s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, now that inflation seems to be heading back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel.\nThe Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year.\nForeign currencies, DOWN against the dollar\nTrump has vowed to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries, raising worries about trade wars and disruptions to the global economy. A measure of the U.S. dollar’s value against several major currencies climbed 1.6%, which means that those other currencies fell.\nThe euro sank 1.5%, and the South Korean won fell 1.2% The Mexican peso, which has been falling against the dollar since the summer, in part on worries about a possible Trump re-election, fell early in the day but then pared its loss.\nRewnewable energy stocks, DOWN\nTrump is a fan of fossil fuels, encouraging production of oil and natural gas. His win sent solar stocks sharply lower, including a 10.1% fall for First Solar and 16.8% slide for Enphase Energy.\nThe only stock with a bigger loss in the S&P 500 was Super Micro Computer, which said its sales for the latest quarter could come in below its prior forecast. Its stock sank 18.1%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 146.28 points to 5,929.04. The Dow surged 1,508.05 to 43,729.93, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 544.29 to 18,983.47.\n___\nAP Writers Zimo Zhong, Elaine Kurtenbach, Kirstin Grieshaber and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.\nStan Choe, The Associated Press\nCheck out Village Report - the news that matters most to Canada, updated throughout the day.  Or, subscribe to Village Report's free daily newsletter: a compilation of the news you need to know, sent to your inbox at 6AM.\nSubscribe","Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of just over $76,000, setting a new record only hours after surpassing the $75,000 mark on Tuesday night. Following Donald Trump’s reelection, strong support within the crypto community for his return to the White House continues to fuel Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Celebrating Trump’s victory, Bitcoin advocate and MicroStrategy (MSTR) founder Michael Saylor posted on X,  “We have a #Bitcoin President.”\nThe leading cryptocurrency hit a record high of $76,243 at approximately 4:00 PM on Wednesday, representing an impressive 9% increase within the last 24 hours. According to crypto tracking website CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency has surged 110,968% since 2013. This means a $100 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1 million.\nBitcoin’s price is expected to rise further, showing heightened optimism and enthusiasm among investors due to recent political developments. The momentum shows no signs of slowing — among seasoned traders and newcomers alike.\nBitcoin’s new all-time high has buoyed the entire cryptocurrency market, sparking notable gains across various digital assets. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $2,671, marking an increase of over 9% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, popular memecoins saw substantial upticks: Dogecoin jumped more than 11%, while Shiba Inu was up over 7% in the same period. Solana also experienced an increase of 12%.\nMeanwhile, companies tied to crypto, such as Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Tesla (TSLA), saw significant gains Wednesday following Trump’s reelection.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","The big picture: The world's leading cryptocurrency entered 2024 in a slump, with the value of a single coin hovering near the $40,000 as the calendar rolled over. The debut of US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January had a huge impact on the market and by March, Bitcoin's value had surged to more than $70,000. Now, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of more than $75,000 in what could be the start of a record run for the popular cryptocurrency following the US presidential election.\nValue has fluctuated between $55,000 and $70,000 over the past several months, but Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has shaken up the market.\nAJ Bell analyst Russ Mould told The Guardian just ahead of the election on Tuesday that many investors believed that a Republican win would result in a surge for the cryptocurrency. Nigel Green from financial advisory group deVere said a Trump win could be the catalyst that pushes the digital currency into uncharted territory.\nAs the publication highlights, Trump initially viewed cryptocurrencies as a scam but later changed his stance. Green added that Trump's return to the White House could result in a renewed emphasis on deregulation, tax breaks, and other policies that could favor alternative investments like Bitcoin.\nOther cryptocurrencies are also riding the political wave. Ethereum is up eight percent over the last 24 hours, Solana has increased more than 10 percent in the same period, and Dogecoin is up 9.19 percent.\nDuring his campaign, Trump promised to make America the crypto capital of the world. A report from the Associated Press noted plans to create a \"strategic reserve\" of Bitcoin if elected. He also spoke at a cryptocurrency conference over the summer, and even accepted cryptocurrency donations during his campaign.\nBitcoin was also in the news recently after an HBO documentary named Canadian developer Peter Todd as the mysterious creator of the cryptocurrency. Todd denied the claims and ultimately went into hiding.\nImage credit: Getty Images, Choong Deng Xiang"]}

Meanwhile, Bitcoin briefly crossed $76,000 on Wednesday, setting a new all-time high. Additionally, the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) experienced significant inflows of $622 million following Trump’s reelection.\nThe crypto community is buzzing, with celebrations sweeping across forums and social media, hailing Trump’s win as a potential boon for the top cryptocurrency’s future. And Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that is rising — others are also up following Trump’s victory.\n2 \/ 5\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been rallying alongside Bitcoin. On Election Day, Ether was trading around $2,400, but it has since surged to $2,800 — a more than 16% bump in just two days.\nIn addition, spot Ether ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have experienced renewed inflows following Trump’s victory, reversing a period of sustained outflows. According to data from crypto ETF tracker Farside, investors poured $52 million into spot Ether ETFs on November 6.\n3 \/ 5\nThe popular and highly volatile memecoin Dogecoin was expected to react strongly to Trump’s victory. A key driver of its recent upward momentum is its association with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a self-proclaimed “Dogefather” and open supporter of Trump this year.\nIt’s no surprise, then, that Dogecoin surged from $0.16 to $0.21 in just two days, marking an impressive 31.25% increase.\n4 \/ 5\nSolana, regarded as a competitor to Ethereum, has experienced significant growth over the years, driven by its speed and efficiency. User activity on the Solana blockchain has surged, making it a popular platform for hosting decentralized applications.\nAfter Trump’s victory, the price of Solana surged from $160 to $196, marking a 22.5% increase in just two days.\n5 \/ 5","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nBitcoin's recent price fluctuations have left some investors anxious, but industry leaders remain confident in the cryptocurrency's long-term value.\nRoundtable anchor Rob Nelson led a discussion with David Gokhshtein, Founder of Gokhshtein Media, and Dirk Lueth, CEO of Upland, addressing concerns over market volatility and the future of digital assets.\n\"Relax,\" urged David Gokhshtein. \"We just hit numbers that we haven't seen since when, and you're panicking because we had a little bit of a pullback?\" He emphasized that demand for bitcoin remains strong, noting that \"People are desperate to get their hands on bitcoin,\" and there's \"Not enough bitcoin to be sold OTC to people that are desperately wanting to get bitcoin into their hands.\"\nFollowing the results in the U.S. election, Bitcoin swung to a record high after billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin ETFs last week.\nRob Nelson highlighted the skepticism some have toward cryptocurrencies. \"They don't understand; most stocks don't do these jumps like this,\" he said, recounting a conversation with a traditional investor who prefers tangible assets. Nelson asked Dirk Lueth why people panic over bitcoin's volatility despite being deep in the crypto space.\nDirk Lueth compared the current sentiment toward bitcoin to the early days of digital media. \"In the early 2000s, I co-founded a newspaper... people approached me, 'No, I want to hold something in my hand. I want to smell the printing press,'\" he recalled. \"And then fast forward what happened to newspapers, everything's gone digital these days.\" Lueth believes bitcoin will follow a similar path as people begin to understand its value as a virtual asset.\n\"I'm not getting nervous these days,\" Lueth stated, reflecting on his decade-long experience in the crypto space. While acknowledging market fluctuations, he remains optimistic: \"I believe that bitcoin and not just bitcoin, all the other Altcoins... many of them... have a bright future ahead of them.\" Both Gokhshtein and Lueth agreed that education and time will alleviate fears, and that the crypto market's growth is a natural progression as it matures.","We need your help now\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Find out more.\nWell, that was all very exciting wasn’t it?\nAfter the frenzy that was the US election results, we can take a bit of a step back and look at the business reaction.\nDonald Trump’s (re)ascension to the White House received a rapid response from financial markets – with the US dollar, cryptocurrencies and US stock markets all surging.\nWe’ve already looked at the biggest possible risk of a Trump presidency to Ireland’s economy – namely, that US multinationals stop shifting profits here, leading to a massive drop in our corporate tax take.\nBut that’s still just a hypothetical. Here’s a quick rundonw of how businesses reacted to yesterday’s dramatic election results.\nThe key takeaway here was the jump in the value of…well, everything.\nUS stocks hit record highs and the dollar surged following Donald Trump’s re-election as president.\nThe dollar gained almost 2% in value against many major currencies, while Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of nearly $76,000.\nInvestors were essentially betting on Trump following through on his stated priorities, which he has said will include tax cuts and increased tariffs.\nTariffs are essentially taxes which are placed on goods or services which are imported or exported by a country. It is expected that Trump could place tariffs on goods coming into the US economy in an effort to lower competition for American businesses from foreign companies.\nThe eurozone, Mexico and China have all been mentioned as potential targets for tariffs.\nInvestors anticipate that these moves could lead to higher US economic growth, but also a rise in inflation. US shoppers could end up paying higher prices, whether due to lower competition raising prices or importers passing along the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.\nAdvertisement\nWhile this concern has frequently been raised by economists, it’s one Trump himself has dismissed, stating of his first term in the White House, starting in 2016: “I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation”.\nHowever, if higher inflation did materialise, it would reduce the ability of the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nWhile this would keep borrowing costs higher for consumers, it would also likely keep the value of the dollar higher compared to other currencies.\nThis was why the value of the dollar rose.\nThe price of Bitcoin jumped by over 8% before falling back slightly as of the time of writing.\nThis is because Trump has come out with multiple pro-cryptocurrency statements in recent months, in particular talking up Bitcoin.\nStock markets also jumped. The S&P 500, which is a list of the 500 biggest companies operating in the US, rose by 2.5% – the biggest post-election day rise in its history.\nAlongside his policies, which favour domestic growth, Trump is also viewed as supporting lower corporate tax rates and deregulation.\nInvestors think all of these are likely to further boost corporate profits – hence the market jump.\nHowever, while US investors rejoiced, there were mixed feelings elsewhere.\nA trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street wears Trump merchandise, the morning after Election Day.                    Alamy\n\n\n    Alamy\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 dipped by 0.6% yesterday, although it then rose by 0.4% today.\nThe choppy trading comes because investors think Trump’s re-election could be bad news for Europe, particularly for the likes of Germany. The country is heavily reliant on exports, which could take a hit if Trump follows through on his tariffs plan.\nAsian stocks were also up and down, dropping yesterday before making somewhat of a comeback today. China trended more towards the latter, with the value of its yuan currency compared to the dollar dropping by as much as 0.9% at one point yesterday.\nRelated Reads\n\n\n\n\nSimon Harris says Ireland will work with Trump, but must prepare for impact on economy and Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real risk of a Trump presidency to Ireland - the end of our corporate tax bonanza\nFigures closer to home also raised similar concerns. A report published yesterday by a think tank called the National Institute of Economic and Social Research painted a bleak picture for the UK economy.\nEven without Trump’s tariff plan, it predicted that UK economic growth will range between a lacklustre 1% and 2% in the coming years.\nHowever, the think tank warned that this already mediocre rate could be more than halved if Trump follows through with introducing more taxes for overseas products.\nThe Irish stock exchange followed the broad European trend, dropping yesterday before rising by 0.7% today as of the time of writing.\nDomestic banks are viewed as being particularly vulnerable to any dialling back of US multinational activities, with shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland dropping by 1% and 5% respectively. Today, shares in AIB dipped further, while Bank of Ireland rebounded.\nIt perhaps reflects some of the uncertainty Irish investors and businesses feel about what Trump’s win means for them.\nGiven Ireland’s close trading ties with the US, talk of tariffs has created uneasiness. Dan O’Brien, chief economist at the Institute of European Affairs, said tariffs represent “one of the biggest near-term risks to the Irish and European economies”.\nThat was broadly in line with what comments from most other Irish economists and analysts.\nThe broad sentiment was that while it’s still early days, any talk of protectionism in the US should set off alarm bells in Ireland.\nOf course, during Trump’s last presidency between 2016 and 2020, concerns about the same thing proved unfounded, as US multinationals grew their presence in Ireland and shifted increasing amounts of money here.\nBut the mood music has changed since then, and most observers feel that Ireland would do well to ride its luck a second time.\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n            \n\n                Our Explainer articles bring context and explanations in plain language to help make sense of complex issues.\n                \n                    We're asking readers like you to support us so we can continue to provide helpful context to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.\n                \n\n\n\n\n                Learn More\n            \n\n                Support The Journal\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n600px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/business-reaction-trump-election-us-ireland-europe-6535932-Nov2024\/?embedpost=6535932&width=600&height=460\" ><\/iframe>\n400px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/business-reaction-trump-election-us-ireland-europe-6535932-Nov2024\/?embedpost=6535932&width=400&height=460\" ><\/iframe>\n300px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/business-reaction-trump-election-us-ireland-europe-6535932-Nov2024\/?embedpost=6535932&width=300&height=460\" ><\/iframe>"]}

For those who do not have a deep understanding of cryptocurrency, there has been some concern regarding its place in the global financial market. As we reach the end of 2024 and head into 2025, what are the thoughts surrounding cryptocurrency, and has the global financial market finally embraced crypto?\nIn January 2024, Bitcoin took a significant step forward regarding global financial market acceptance by entering the world’s largest stock market, Wall Street. That means there is now trading of cryptocurrency on the exchange and 644,860 bitcoin was held by 11 U.S. ETFs after just two trading days. With Donald Trump entering the Whitehouse for a second term, the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto-related stocks soared, and the new president has said he will turn the United States into “the crypto capital of the planet”. Trump and his sons recently launched a crypto business, so the president of the United States has a significant interest in the cryptocurrency industry.\nThis is good news for anyone launching cryptocurrency products in the coming months and years. The upcoming ICO of Wall Street Pepe is a good example and the meme coin WEPE is using a multifaceted approach, which should sit well in the current climate following the announcement of Trump as the new president. Community engagement, humor, and strategy combine to make Wall Street Pepe an interesting opportunity for investors. Using Pepe the Frog, a popular internet meme, this is an intriguing meme-based cryptocurrency, featuring a decentralized exchange (DEX) launch, and one to follow.\nCryptocurrency has been accepted, rejected, and somewhat ignored by various nations and governments throughout the years. However, this is changing and governments worldwide are considering ways to regulate digital currencies. One of the main reasons for this is the collapse of several banks that had ties to the crypto industry. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank in the United States are three examples of banks with crypto ties that recently collapsed. If we continue with the United States, the country has introduced two bills, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. These have helped to provide some definitions and the roles of various bodies in the US when it comes to managing cryptocurrencies.\nIn 2023, the European Union introduced the Markets in Crytpo-Assets Regulation and any company trading or issuing cryptocurrency needs a license. By January 2026, cryptocurrency service providers, regardless of the amount, will need the full name of the recipient when sending cryptocurrency. In addition, The International Organization of Securities Commissions has set out several recommendations for the global management of crypto assets.\nOn the face of it, this may seem like extra work for crypto traders and one of the many benefits of owning and trading cryptocurrencies was the lack of any regulatory framework. However, if it leads to further adoption of crypto by global financial markets, it will be a positive step.\nA strong sign the global financial market has finally embraced crypto is the acceptance of digital currencies as legal tender. El Salvador and the Central African Republic are two countries that have taken the next major step in crypto acceptance by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. There is likely to be more room for crypto innovation, market expansion, and acceptance in nations that have accepted cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, as legal tender.\nDigital currencies and the crypto sector have undergone substantial changes in recent years. We have seen a broader adoption of cryptocurrency in the mainstream financial markets, and this will continue thanks to the development of easier-to-use interfaces. There have been setbacks in recent years, which cannot be denied but they were overcome, and that alone is a reason to be optimistic. With governments worldwide openly discussing crypto and introducing bills and legislation, it’s only a matter of time before blockchain technology is integrated into existing global financial systems.\nGet in front of thousands of founders, investors, PE firms, tech executives, decision makers, and tech readers by submitting your story to TechStartups.com.","SUMMARY\nThis is AI generated summarization, which may have errors.

As of around 3:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin’s price stood at $87,083, per CoinDesk, up over 28% in the last week alone.\nThat’s part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated “crypto-friendly” nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.\nStill, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.\nBack up. What is cryptocurrency again?\nCryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but seen come under the spotlight in recent years.\nIn basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority – meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution – and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money – but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.\nWhy are bitcoin and other crypto assets soaring now?\nA lot of it has to do with the outcome of last week’s election.\nTrump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year’s presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.\nCrypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.\n“Crypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,” Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being “crypto-friendly” and a potential shift in regulatory backing.\nEven before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.\nInflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, “have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,” Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.\nWhat are the risks?\nCrypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value – which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.\nIn short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behaviour relies on larger market conditions.\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.\nAt the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool – and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.\n“Investors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. “Because we’ve seen these wild swings in the past.”\nWhat about the climate impact?\nAssets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\nIn the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has “grown very rapidly over the last several years,” adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.","NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Monday, led by those seen as benefiting the most from Donald Trump’s reelection  as president, but drops for some high-profile Big Tech stocks kept indexes in check.\nThe S&P 500 edged up by 0.1%, coming off its best week of the year following Trump’s victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy.

Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 304 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%.\nTesla was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 9.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump’s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.\nSeveral pieces of what’s known as the “Trump trade” also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, and financial stocks again helped lead the market on expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\nA White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It’s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn’t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna’s stock rose 7.3%, and Humana’s sank 2%.\nStocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they’re seen as benefiting more from Trump’s America First policies than big multinational companies.\nThey helped offset a drop of 1.6% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market.\nSuch Big Tech stocks have rocketed higher on excitement about artificial-intelligence technology, and they had been gaining almost regardless of what the economy was doing. Now, though, critics say their prices look too expensive, and investors are finding more interesting buys among companies that could benefit more from Trump’s second term.\nA drop for Nvidia packs a particularly heavy punch because its massive value of nearly $3.6 trillion makes it one of the most influential stocks on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\nAbbVie, meanwhile, tumbled 12.6% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.\nSome of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $87,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies  generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $87,491, according to CoinDesk.\nAnother Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump’s policies. But trading in the bond market was closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.\nTreasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.\nBut Trump’s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.\nStill, many professional investors warn not to get carried away by all the big swings following Trump’s victory. It takes time to see what campaign promises turn into actual policy, and that can lead to snaps back for the market’s initial knee-jerk reactions.\nThe U.S. stock market is also broadly looking more expensive, as prices continue to run up faster than corporate profits.\n“Valuations are increasingly elevated, and the pace of growth isn’t sustainable,” according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. “While near-term seasonality will be a strong tailwind for markets, valuations may prove to be a tipping point as we move into 2025.”\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 5.81 points Monday to 6,001.35.

Tesla's market value soared to $1.1 trillion, driven by anticipation of benefits from CEO Elon Musk's close ties to Trump. Other stocks have also gained since Trump's election victory.\nThe S&P 500 financial index saw a rally, with bank stocks boosting the Dow to unprecedented levels. The small-cap Russell 2000 reached its highest point since November 2021, reflecting expectations that Trump's proposed tax cuts and regulatory leniencies could benefit smaller firms. Conversely, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms experienced declines.\nWith the S&P 500 gaining almost 4% and the Nasdaq nearly 5% since Trump's win, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions and upcoming economic data, including consumer price inflation reports. Market sentiments suggest a possible Santa Claus rally following the post-election surge, albeit with cautious monitoring of price pressures.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nBitcoin's trajectory for 2025 stirred debate as Co-Host of Altcoin Daily, Austin Arnold, joined Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom, Arthur Hayes, to discuss the impact of the recent election and macroeconomic policies on the cryptocurrency market.\nArthur Hayes projected a bold forecast for Bitcoin, stating, “I would say my price tag is between $100,000 to $250,000 by the end of next year,” though he cautioned that Federal Reserve policies could shape outcomes dramatically.\nHayes also predicted Trump's victory could prompt a hawkish pivot from the Fed. Last week, the Fed decided to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. “We may see a liquidity drain if Trump takes office, with the monetary arm going on strike for the 50 or 60 days until inauguration.” This delay, he suggested, could exacerbate volatility, particularly with a debt ceiling negotiation looming at the start of the year.\nThe Fed's most recent rate cut, however, has further propelled Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency surging to a new all-time high on Monday after spiking to $87,000. Other analysts, including Fundstrat's Sean Farrell had predicted a continually dovish Fed would propel Bitcoin to $115,000 by the end of the year.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he would not step down if pressured to by President Trump. The Fed's next policy decision is in December. Traders are assigning about a 66% chance of another 25-basis-point cut, according to the CME's Fed Watch tool.\nAttention now turns to control of the House, which has all but been secured by Republicans. Only a few races remained too close to call as of Monday, with Republicans just shy of the number needed to ensure they would be in the driver's seat to set budgetary policy after Trump takes office.\nHayes concluded that while both parties might ultimately push liquidity, timing and personnel changes under Trump could introduce temporary hurdles, leading to a short-term liquidity strike that could significantly impact bitcoin markets.","ASX edges lower as BHP, Paladin Energy retreat\nTesla short sellers just lost $8 billion\nOil holds loss after sell-off\nASX slips as miners fall; Paladin Energy sinks, Block rallies\nCost of living has been ‘politicised’, says Coles boss\nUranium miner cuts ‘ambitious’ targets\nJoshua Peach\nDeclines in iron ore, gold, and oil prices dragged the sharemarket lower for a second day to exacerbate the ongoing sell-down in commodities.\nThe S&P\/ASX 200 Index closed 10.6 points lower, or 0.1 per cent, to 8255.6 points, adding to Monday’s 0.4 per cent decline. Mining stocks finished down 1.4 per cent, with BHP falling 1.8 per cent to $40.90, after iron ore prices slipped around 2 per cent to near $US100 per tonne.\nIron ore and copper prices have continued to fall since China undershot market expectations in the latest batch of stimulus measures announced Friday despite the spectre of higher tariffs under US president-elect Donald Trump.\nCommonwealth Bank commodity strategist Vivek Dhar warned iron ore prices could fall further still.\n“We think iron ore prices are likely to slip below $US100 per tonne in the near term due to steel demand concerns,” he said. “But we believe policymakers have left the door open to more stimulus … Chinese policymakers may also be waiting for clearer signals of tariffs from the second Trump administration before responding with additional stimulus.”\nCoal and oil prices also slipped on Chinese demand concerns, weighing further on ASX energy stocks, which ended the session 1.6 per cent lower. Brent crude held steady after falling nearly 3 per cent to below $US72 during US trading on Monday.\nSpot gold fell 2.4 per cent to near $US2617 an ounce during the US session as traders booked profits from the precious metal’s strong rally into the presidential election. That sent ASX-listed gold miners lower. West African Resources, Emerald Resources and Bellevue Gold were all among the worst-performing on the ASX 200, each down around 5 per cent.\nMeanwhile, other so-called “Trump trades” continued to march on. The US dollar gained, bringing the Australian dollar to a three-month low near US65.5¢, while bitcoin topped $US89,000.\nUranium miner Paladin Energy dived 28.9 per cent to $6.88 after cutting its production guidance, citing issues at its Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia. Other ASX uranium stocks followed in kind. Deep Yellow fell 6.9 per cent to $1.20 and Boss Energy lost 4.5 per cent to $2.99.\nLiontown Resources added 4.2 per cent to 87.5¢, despite the lithium developer being downgraded to a “sell” rating by Citi analysts, citing balance sheet concerns.

Techgraph has called the boosts the \"Trump Effect.\"\nBitcoin is now catching up on the $1.804 trillion valuation of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's majority state-owned petroleum and natural gas company. It still lags considerably behind tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google, as well as software company NVIDIA, all of which make the top five. Gold maintains its position as the world's top valued asset with a market cap of $17.6 trillion.\nThere have also been rallies among cryptocurrency prices, spearheaded by Bitcoin, having risen by 15.03 percent in the past five days to $87,320.08. The world's biggest and most well-known cryptocurrency has now more than doubled from a year's low of $38,505 in January.\nEthereum has also risen to $3,275.43, after a five-day increase of 13.09 percent. Dogecoin rose 102.48 percent to $0.39 in the five days leading up to Tuesday, November 12.\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump's interest in the cryptocurrency market grew, despite him previously deriding Bitcoin as \"a scam.\"\n\"I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar,\" he said in 2021. He later said he wanted the U.S. to become \"the crypto capital of the planet.\"\nThough he has yet to outline any specific policies, Trump has since engaged with the crypto community and attended industry events, including appearances as a keynote speaker at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee, in July.

That gives it a lead on silver’s $1.71 trillion market cap, but still falls well short of gold’s estimated $17.52 trillion.\nBitcoin’s price had risen 5.6% over the prior 24 hours, adding to a rally that saw its value surge 30% in less than a week and hit several new record highs.\nBitcoin is expected to continue barreling forward as investors’ optimism and enthusiasm grows on Trump’s return to the White House.

On Thursday alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, led with more than $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside.\nBitcoin’s new all-time highs have lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across a number of other digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was priced at more than $3,200 as of Tuesday morning, and Dogecoin jumped 30% in the past 24 hours. Others, including Solana and Cardano, have taken a tumble.\nAll together, the global crypto market has a valuation of $2.91 trillion, a 4.09% increase in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap.\n— Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are gravitating towards platforms that simplify asset management and ensure maximum returns.

These developments could accelerate Trump's policy proposals as he prepares to control Congress, which could entail reduced taxes and potential trade confrontations.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","12th Nov, 2024. 01:44 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 10, 2024\nAs of Nov 12, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $89135.61.

In 2027, brokers will include \"cost basis,\" or the original purchase price for sales in 2026.\nHere's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.\nBasis is important because, generally, if you can't prove your basis, the IRS considers it zero — which can inflate gains. Your profit is the sales price minus your basis.\nThe price of bitcoin jumped above $93,000 on Wednesday, notching a fresh record that added to the post-election rally.\n\"People don't necessarily think of the tax consequences, especially when they see that we're going up very rapidly,\" said Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and owner of MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York, where he specializes in digital assets.\nPreviously, crypto investors could track basis using the \"universal method,\" which combines assets into a single account, even for crypto held in multiple digital wallets.\nUnder the universal method, crypto investors could assign an asset's basis when selling, based on their inventory method.\nBut starting in 2025, the \"universal method is going away\" and reporting will happen at the wallet level, according to Sulolit Mukherjee, executive director of compliance and implementation for the IRS' Office of Digital Asset Initiative.\nIn the meantime, investors must establish a \"reasonable allocation\" of basis by Jan. 1, 2025, according to the IRS revenue procedure released in July.\nInvestors should provide their broker with these details to avoid a \"reporting nightmare\" in the future, said Mukherjee, speaking at the American Institute of CPAs' national tax conference in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.\nThe new IRS reporting requirements come as the agency focuses on digital asset enforcement.\n\"These regulations are an important part of the larger effort on high-income individual tax compliance,\" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement in July. \"We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets.\"","The Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 11, 2015.Robert Galbraith\/Reuters\nThe U.S. Supreme Court scrutinized on Wednesday Nvidia’s NVDA-Q bid to torpedo a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales depended on the volatile cryptocurrency market.\nThe justices heard arguments in Nvidia’s appeal of a lower court’s decision allowing a 2018 class action – litigation led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB – to proceed. It is one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month that could lead to rulings making it harder for private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving Meta’s Facebook, was argued on Nov. 6.\nAt issue in the Nvidia case is whether the plaintiffs cleared the heightened legal bar for bringing private securities fraud suits as set by Congress in a 1995 federal law called the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that aimed to screen out frivolous lawsuits.\nSome of the justices expressed reservations about intervening in the case, wondering about whether there is a clear legal issue for them to decide, as opposed to just a dispute over facts – and given the technical complexities involved they may not be ideally placed to resolve.\n“It just seems to me that you’re asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at and weren’t expecting when we took this case,” liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Neal Katyal, the lawyer arguing for Nvidia.\nLiberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed concern that the standard Nvidia has asked the court to adopt would place too heavy a burden on plaintiffs.\n“I guess my concern is that you appear to be requiring for plaintiffs to actually have the evidence in order to plead their case,” Jackson said, noting that critical evidence often is not obtained by plaintiffs until a later stage of litigation.\nThe plaintiffs accused Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang of violating a 1934 federal law called the Securities Exchange Act by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia’s revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\nConservative Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to search for a middle ground.\n“If I think that the positions on both sides are a little too absolute, how do you find sort of the sweet spot in terms of when the (Private Securities Litigation Reform Act) is satisfied?” Roberts asked Katyal.\nThe higher legal standards under the law mean that plaintiffs need more than “just a little bit of direct evidence,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it seems to me you can’t insist on only the direct evidence before a complaint goes forward. So if I don’t think it’s black and white, how ... do I decide where the balance is?”\nBeginning in 2017, as the price of certain cryptocurrencies rose, Nvidia’s chips became increasingly popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.\nBy late 2018, amid a decline in crypto profitability, Nvidia’s revenue fell short of its projections, leading its stock price to fall in early November of that year.\nThe plaintiffs accused Nvidia and its top officials of concealing the impact of cryptomining on its business. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Nvidia stock held by the investors.\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5-million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business, but without admitting or denying the findings of federal regulators.\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Deepak Gupta, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, to respond to Nvidia’s argument that their allegations about how much of the company’s sales went to crypto miners relied heavily on an expert opinion by the economic consulting firm, Prysm Group, that contained too few details to clear the initial phase of litigation.\nGupta called Nvidia’s claim “an inaccurate characterization of the report.”\n“Basically what Prysm was doing was math,” Gupta said. “It was taking publicly available figures and doing some multiplication.”\nA federal judge dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently revived it.\nConservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh raised a concern expressed to the Supreme Court by outside interest groups that the 9th Circuit decision created “a blueprint” for getting around heightened legal bar set by Congress in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. President Joe Biden’s administration supported the shareholders in the case.\nThe Supreme Court’s rulings in the Facebook and Nvidia cases are expected by the end of June.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nStudy and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

This market surge, dubbed the \"Trump Effect\" by news platform Techgraph, reflects optimism around anticipated economic policies favoring business growth and investment.\nSince Tuesday, Bitcoin's valuation has climbed significantly, approaching the $1.804 trillion market cap of Saudi Aramco, the Saudi state-controlled petroleum and natural gas giant. However, Bitcoin still trailed behind tech leaders including Microsoft, Apple, Google, and NVIDIA, which hold the top positions globally. Gold remains the world's most valuable asset, with an unmatched market capitalization of $17.6 trillion on Tuesday.\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump's interest in the cryptocurrency market grew, despite him previously deriding Bitcoin as \"a scam.\"\n\"I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar,\" he said in 2021. He later said he wanted the U.S. to become \"the crypto capital of the planet.\"\nAlthough he has not detailed specific crypto policies, Donald Trump has shown increasing engagement with the cryptocurrency community, including serving as a keynote speaker at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee, last July.\nTrump also announced he would create \"a bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council,\" offering a more collaborative approach to crypto regulation by giving industry insiders a seat at the table.\nFurther signaling his interest in the sector, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, in September. These moves reflect a growing alignment with the industry, suggesting potential crypto-friendly initiatives in his upcoming term.\nExperts had anticipated a surge in cryptocurrency markets following Trump's election victory, driven partly by his commitment to ousting SEC Chair Gary Gensler and bolstering Bitcoin mining within the U.S., as reported by Coin Telegraph. These potential policy changes are seen as favorable to the crypto sector, with investors expecting reduced regulatory barriers and increased support for digital asset development in the country.\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's representatives for a comment via email.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\nMichael D.

Smaller cryptocurrency ether is up about 33 per cent since the vote to US$3,220.\nDogecoin, an alternative and volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk, has gained 140 per cent.\nCrypto exchange-traded funds have also been snapped up, possibly an indicator of buying by financial institutions which tend to shy away from directly holding cryptocurrencies.\nSpot bitcoin ETFs have attracted about US$4.05-billion in net flows since Nov. 6, based on Refinitiv Lipper data, around 15 per cnet of the total inflows since they launched in January.\n“People wanted more exposure to crypto, clearly, from the Trump presidency and they wanted more risky asset exposure in general,” said David Glass digital assets strategist at Citi.\n“From the crypto front, there’s the story of removing regulatory headwinds, and the potential strategic bitcoin reserve.”\nMr. Trump has made reference to a U.S. “strategic bitcoin reserve”, similar to that of gold, which would be held by the U.S. government, but the details are unclear.\nThe current upsurge could have further to run.\n“Bitcoin enthusiasts are known for bold predictions, but hitting US$100,000 by year-end seems feasible,” said Carl Szantyr, founder and managing partner at Blockstone Capital.\nThe explosive rally is the latest in the boom-bust roller coaster that had bitcoin below US$20,000 at the start of last year, in the depths of the “crypto winter” that followed the collapse of brokerage FTX and other crypto projects.\nTo be sure, cryptocurrencies’ market value is dwarfed by traditional asset classes. At current prices, the value of the 209,000 tonnes of gold the World Gold Council says has been mined in history is worth nearly US$19-trillion.\nThe market capitalisation of the S&P 500 index is US$50.6-trillion.\nSome parts of the ecosystem do also not show signs of recovery and others point to a degree of caution. Average sales prices for non-fungible tokens have been around US$2,000 since May, according to NonFungible.com, which tracks the Ethereum and Ronin blockchains, and have kicked up, but only to about US$2,700.\nIn Singapore DBS Bank, which operates a digital exchange, said while trading had surged and it had executed more than one-third of last year’s total volume in the first ten days of November, investors were not yet heading into the more obscure parts of the market.\n“We’ve not seen our clients shift their assets towards more exotic platforms or decentralised exchanges,” said David Hui, chief commercial officer of DBS Digital Exchange.\nStill, those in the industry say the renewed attention will bring momentum.\n“There’s increased interest and willingness to look at DeFi and other possibilities associated with blockchain,” said Danny Chong, a co-founder of decentralised asset tracking platform Tranchess.\n“The heightened market capitalisation, which if sustained for a longer period, would likely also invite deeper interest into new and existing themes,” he said, including tokenisation of real world assets and blockchain-based payment services.\nBe smart with your money.

These changes are expected to fuel inflation and possibly slow the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting measures over the longer term. Expectations for increased deficit spending have sent Treasury yields higher, further supporting the dollar.\nThe projection from Edison Research that the Republican Party will control both congressional houses upon Trump's January inauguration grants him significant power to advance his policy goals. Economic expert Chris Weston of Pepperstone referred to the USD as a 'magical currency' sustained by carry, momentum, growth differentials, and anticipated fiscal and tariff changes.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025"]}

The cryptocurrency surpassed the $90,000 level to reach an all-time high earlier this week, although it has pared gains.\nDuring the election price volatility, some hedge funds have been taking advantage of a price difference between spot bitcoin and its derivatives in the futures market in a leveraged trade, according to analysts. Spot ETFs were approved by the Securities and Exchanged Commission earlier this year.\nIn the so-called bitcoin basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin - or its ETFs - and short the cryptocurrency futures, which have been trading at substantially higher prices this year. This gap widened after the election result and on Nov. 11 reached 17% in an annual basis, CF Bitcoin data showed, but pared gains to 12% on Friday.\n“Hedge funds are harvesting that spread. It creates a very tactical, opportunistic trade,” said Gabe Selby, head of research at Kraken’s CF Benchmarks. “It has an uncorrelated return.”\nPositions unveiled in 13-F filings this week only show long equity bets placed by hedge funds and not wagers on the fall of share prices or derivatives.

It also increased its positions in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin and Bitwise Bitcoin funds.\nOverall, the New York-based hedge fund ended September with $1.7 billion in crypto ETFs, including spot bitcoin and ethereum funds. The ETFs account for a small portion of the firm’s $70 billion in assets under management.\nCapula, a London-based macro hedge fund, also added more shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, according to an SEC filing on Thursday. Those positions totaled roughly $600 million.\nPaul Tudor Jones’ hedge fund Tudor turbocharged its exposure to iShares Bitcoin Trust fund, increasing its number of shares by five times, to 4.4 million.\nSchonfeld Strategic Partners is also a hedge fund that added more shares in bitcoin funds.\nMillennium and Tudor declined to comment on their positions. The other hedge funds did not immediately comment on the matter.\nIf hedge funds kept their positions through the fourth quarter, they could be poised to post big gains. Since the end of September, spot bitcoin ETFs are up roughly 40%, mainly driven by the result of the U.S. presidential election.\nGiven bitcoin’s more volatile price, many hedge funds prefer more neutral trades that do not take a directional bet on its rise or fall.\nDavid Duong, Coinbase’s institutional head of research, said the bitcoin basis trade has climbed for the last few weeks. “Leading into the election, we had multiple clients actually requesting increases in their credit lines (to trade),” he added.\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.",null,"The dollar is experiencing a significant weekly gain, the largest in over a month, fueled by expectations that President-elect Donald Trump's policies may boost U.S. inflation.\nThe currency's strength is supported by predictions of fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts, impacting various global markets, including the euro zone and Japan.\nInvestors are recalibrating their strategies around major currencies and cryptocurrencies, as the market anticipates economic policy shifts under Trump's presidency and the subsequent impacts on global trade.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","The final quarter of 2023 signals a vibrant period for the cryptocurrency market.

The chipmaker’s hefty weighting in the S&P 500 has helped drive the index to record highs in 2024.\nBut Nvidia’s blistering multi-year run has also raised the bar for earnings outperformance - a slip-up could fuel worries that the market’s AI hopes have outstripped reality.\nAnalysts see Nvidia increasing third-quarter revenue by over 80% to $32.9 billion when it reports its results on Nov. 20, LSEG data showed earlier this month.\nTrump’s win has unleashed a stampede of crypto bulls intent on driving bitcoin to the moon. The price has risen 30% since the Nov. 5 election day and, having topped $90,000 for the first time on record, is showing no signs of stopping.\nThe entire crypto market has surpassed $3 trillion for the first time on record. Bitcoin and co are worth about as much as Elon Musk’s Tesla, Facebook parent Meta and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway put together.\nThe promise of light-touch U.S. regulation means investors can’t get enough of bitcoin right now. Flows into exchange-traded funds have rocketed in recent days. LSEG data shows the largest ETFs tracked by Reuters took in a net $3.5 billion in the week to Nov. 14, the most since March 15. There seems to be little standing in the way a six-figure bitcoin price tag.\nThreats of Trump tariffs are heightening fears about the weak euro area economy and the common currency has been flailing. But how low could it go?\nAt around $1.054, the euro has slumped about 5% from more than one-year highs in September. Some analysts now expect it to fall to parity with the dollar.\nThe last ZEW Institute survey showed German investor confidence is gloomy while traders see a one in five chance the European Central Bank will cut rates by 50 basis points next month. Breakdown German GDP data due out on Nov 22 might give more hints.\nLook out for silver linings, though. A weaker euro boosts exporters and faster rate cuts could juice up bank lending and business activity.\nFriday’s preliminary survey data on business activity will sketch a picture of the global economy before Trump returns to the White House in January.\nPMIs from Europe and the U.S. will likely confirm that global manufacturing activity remains stuck in a downturn, while the services sector soldiers ahead.\nEach country is facing its own unique uncertainties. Germany’s flagging economy is on the cusp of new elections, Britain’s employers are bracing for a rise in social security contributions expected to hit hiring and costs. But it’s Trump’s re-election that is dominating the outlook.\nThe survey could give early indications on how U.S. companies are responding to the threat of Trump’s proposed import tariffs - possibly boosting inventories before tariffs kick in - a data point that will be closely watched by markets going forward.\nIndonesia’s central bank will decide on interest rates on Wednesday and it is a toss up whether the policy makers will ease rates or stand pat.\nSlowing inflation, disappointing growth and the Fed’s recent rate cut cement the case for further easing. But the weakening rupiah, currently languishing near three-month lows and down more than 4% from this year’s peak, is putting a spanner in the works for a central bank whose main mandate is to maintain currency stability, even though much of that might be driven by the strong dollar.\nElsewhere in emerging markets, rate decisions in Turkey and South Africa are due on Thursday. South African policymakers are expected to deliver a 25 basis point cut at their final meeting of the year. Upward revisions to inflation forecasts in Turkey make chances of any near-term easing unlikely.\nBe smart with your money.

But if you're in the 0% capital gains bracket, you can reduce future taxes with a lesser-known strategy, experts say.\nThe tactic, known as tax-gain harvesting, is selling profitable crypto in a lower-income year. You can leverage the 0% long-term capital gains rate — meaning you won't owe taxes on gains — as long as earnings are below a certain threshold. The 0% bracket applies to assets owned for more than one year.\n\"That's a very effective strategy if you're in that bracket,\" said Andrew Gordon, a tax attorney, certified public accountant and president of Gordon Law Group.\nHere's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.\nThe income limits for 0% capital gains may be higher than you expect, Gordon said.\nFor 2024, you qualify for the 0% rate with taxable income of $47,025 or less for single filers and $94,050 or less for married couples filing jointly. The brackets are higher for 2025.\nYou calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income. Your taxable income would include profits from a crypto sale.\nFor example, if a married couple earns $125,000 together in 2024, their taxable income may fall below $94,050 after they subtract the $29,200 standard deduction for married couples filing jointly.\nYou can also use the 0% capital gains bracket to reset your \"basis,\" or the original purchase price of crypto, according to Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and owner of MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York.\nIf you're in the 0% bracket, you can sell profitable crypto to harvest gains without triggering taxes. Then, you can repurchase the same asset to maintain your exposure.\nHowever, experts suggest running a tax projection to see how increased income could affect your situation, such as phaseouts for tax breaks.\nThe price of bitcoin was hovering around $90,000, up more than 100% year to date, as of the afternoon on Nov. 18. The value briefly hit a record of $93,000 last week in a postelection rally.\nIt's obviously hard to predict future price increases. However, some investors expect a boost under President-elect Donald Trump, who promised pro-crypto policies on the campaign trail.","The election is behind us and the immediate investor reaction to Trump 2.0 was overwhelmingly positive. On the day after the election, the S&P 500 was up 2.5 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.6%, the NASDAQ Composite gained 2.95%, and the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks surged 5.8%.\nThe quick take is that a Trump administration, working with a Republican Congress, should be able to enact policies that will foster a new burst of economic growth.\nThere are two Trump policies that could stimulate the economy: low taxes and an easing of regulations in industries like energy, banking and crypto. On the tax front, the individual tax cuts that were enacted under the Trump Administration’s Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) of December 2017, were set to sunset — or go back to where they were before the legislation went into effect, at the end of 2025.\nDuring the campaign, the president-elect said that he would prioritize extending those tax cuts and would also like to add more tax relief in the form of excluding certain types of income from taxation, like Social Security benefits, overtime pay and tips. (The TCJA slashed the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 21%, but these cuts were a permanent feature of the law.)\nExtending the TCJA tax cuts would add to the nation’s debt, an issue that may be part of the reason that bond investors seemed to be less thrilled with the outcome of the election. On the day after the result was in, bond prices tanked and yields jumped, partially because of the deficit issue and also due to another pillar of Trump’s campaign: to impose across the board tariffs on imported products.\nTariffs are fees that are slapped on imports, but foreign nations do not pay; rather U.S. importers, like car manufacturers, equipment makers, and construction firms, have to pony up.\nThese companies then have to make the decision of whether they would swallow the extra cost or pass it on to consumers. This chain of events is why economists call tariffs a sales tax on consumers. (It’s also why the small stock index, which is composed of many domestic producers, led the charge higher after the election.)\nPotential new tariffs could complicate the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decisions, just as the nation’s inflation rate is heading toward the central bank’s target. The Fed concluded a pre-scheduled policy meeting two days after the election and cut short term rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4.50 – 4.75%. In the statement, officials said growth is solid, the labor market is easing and there has been progress on inflation, though it still remains higher than the Fed’s target.\nIn the press conference that followed the decision, Chair Jerome Powell deftly avoided answering questions about the impact that potential Trump policies could have on monetary policy. But to state the obvious, if inflation starts to bubble up next year, interest rates could remain higher than currently anticipated.\nThere was a wonderfully candid moment in the presser that brought economic nerd-dom speculation to an end. The back story is that as Trump elevated Powell to lead the Fed in early 2018, he subsequently trash-talked him for keeping interest rates too high.\nDuring the campaign, Trump continued the criticism, though he softened a bit recently. All of this led one reporter to ask Powell whether he would resign as Fed chair early (his term ends in May 2026). In what instantly became a mic-drop moment, Powell looked up from the reporter, into the camera, and quickly answered, “No.”\nJill Schlesinger, CFP, is a CBS News business analyst.

Following the sustained rally triggered by Donald Trump’s recent election victory, analysts anticipate a shift this week. Instead of the relentless upward momentum, the market may take a breather, allowing prices to stabilize and the excitement to settle.\nWith these dynamics in play, let’s delve into what the crypto market might unveil in the days ahead.\n2 \/ 7\nBitcoin reached another peak last week, holding steady—despite some fluctuations—at $90,000. Crypto enthusiasts are eagerly watching and speculating when the flagship cryptocurrency will finally break the $100,000 barrier. With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to assume office, that milestone may not be far off. Bitcoin’s performance is expected to ripple through the entire crypto market.\nAt present, Bitcoin is up nearly 10% compared to last week.\n3 \/ 7\nXRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. It is used by the Ripple payment network to facilitate cross-border transactions and is designed to act as a bridge currency. It’s important to note that Ripple, the company, operates the network but does not own XRP.\nLast week, trading platform Robinhood added XRP to its offerings—a promising development for the token’s accessibility and liquidity. This renewed interest from exchanges is expected to draw more investors and traders to XRP.\nCurrently, XRP is trading at $1.1, with over 92% gain in the past week.\n4 \/ 7\nThe rapid growth of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has also propelled other memecoins, such as Pepe—a frog-themed cryptocurrency that now ranks among the top 20 by market capitalization. Riding the wave of bullish market sentiment, Pepe has surged over 72% in the past week and is currently trading at $0.0000207.\n5 \/ 7\nThe Stellar network, renowned for its efficient and cost-effective blockchain solutions, has earned the trust of major financial institutions globally. Earlier this year, a leader in digital asset infrastructure, Switzerland-based Taurus, announced its integration with the Stellar network, expanding its presence in the asset tokenization market.\nCurrently, Stellar (XLM) is trading at $0.2426, reflecting an impressive 122% gain.\n6 \/ 7\nMantra (OM) (OM) is a specialized blockchain network dedicated to the issuance, trading, and secure management of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). These assets encompass a wide range of categories, including real estate, private equity, artwork, and treasuries. By enabling the tokenization of these tangible assets, Mantra is bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, offering investors a more accessible and secure way to diversify their portfolios.\nMantra partnered with cloud computing giant Google Cloud in late October, sparking a significant rally in the price of its native token. On Sunday, Mantra hit an all-time high of $3.42.\nCurrently, the token is trading at $4.27, marking a staggering 206% gain in just one week.\n7 \/ 7","The stock market rallied to all-time highs on Wednesday following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite indexes each reached new record levels.\nHere's what you need to know about why the market responded in this way, and what it means for your investment strategy.\nAnalysts attribute the market surge to two key factors:\nReduced uncertainty. As I've covered previously, the prospect of a new government and potential policy shifts can create a whirlwind of speculation, leading to market volatility that can unsettle even seasoned investors. An election outcome—regardless of the winner—eliminated the uncertainty that had weighed on the markets prior to the vote. In fact, the U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House.\nProspects of a business-friendly government. Investors are anticipating pro-business policies from a second Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Senate.\nThe Dow closed up over 800 points, or 2.9%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 2.2% and 3.9% respectively. As we've already seen, Trump has a penchant for rolling back or undoing regulations, which benefits sectors that might have experienced greater scrutiny under a Harris administration. Banking, energy, and technology stocks were among the biggest winners in the days following the election.\nWhile this news might make it tempting to buy shares of Tesla or Bitcoin, you might want to take a beat, first. As a rule of thumb, financial advisors caution investors against making sudden, drastic changes to their portfolios based on this one-time event.\nThe so-called \"Trump trade\" could easily turn into a bumpy road—investors should be wary that parts of Trump’s economic platform, such as tax cuts and tariffs, could stoke inflation. Plus, all the details of the timing and implementation of the Republican policy agenda are hardly clear at this time.\nIt's never a good idea to dramatically alter your investment strategy in response to a specific election outcome. Instead, this could be a good time to rebalance and make sure you're not overly exposed to any one sector or company. So while the rally may be tempting, always evaluate your overall asset allocation first before jumping in.\nAllowing current events to constantly sway your financial decisions can lead to emotional stress and decision-making influenced by fear or overconfidence. After all, you're not as objective as you think—here some tips so that you don't lose money over it. In the end, experts recommend staying disciplined and sticking to your long-term investment plan, regardless of who occupies the White House.\nAnd if you experienced some gains and anticipate a big expense in the short term, converting some of your earnings into cash or certificates of deposit could be a good move.\nMeredith is a personal finance aficionado, marathon-runner, and stand-up comedian.\nMeredith is a personal finance aficionado, marathon-runner, and stand-up comedian.","Rexas Finance is making waves in the cryptocurrency sector as its presale stages exceed expectations, notably closing Stage 5 ahead of schedule. This surge in investor interest has led to remarkable outcomes, with initial investors reaping over 200% returns in a short span.\nCentral to Rexas Finance's strategy is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), allowing fractional trading of tangible assets such as real estate and commodities via blockchain technology. This innovative approach democratizes access to high-value markets, traditionally reserved for the affluent and institutions, by providing options for full or partial asset ownership.\nThe recent completion of a Certik audit boosts Rexas Finance's credibility, aligning with its efforts to secure listings on major platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Driven by transparency and inclusivity, Rexas Finance continues to expand its reach through public presales and by seeking listings on top tier 1 exchanges to enhance liquidity and global accessibility.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","18th Nov, 2024. 03:48 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 1, 2024\nAs of Nov 18, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $91867.03.

When I have a specific goal in mind, I am very disciplined about saving and cutting back on unnecessary expenses to reach that goal. However, I also believe in the value of spending on high-quality items that offer long-term benefits or bring me joy. It’s all about balancing thoughtful saving with smart spending choices.\nMy first job was helping my father with his business, installing milking machines on farms. I was about 10 years old, and I was earning £10 per day. My father now works at Activ8, although I pay him considerably more than £10!\nFor everyday personal items, I don’t usually spend much time comparing prices. However, when it comes to business-related decisions, I always make sure to compare options but I prioritise ensuring that service and quality are not compromised in the process.\nLast year, I decided to treat myself to something special and bought a nice car. It was a reward for the hard work, but my wife, Orla, still jokes that it was just a classic midlife crisis purchase. It’s probably the most extravagant thing I’ve ever bought, and while it was expensive, it was also something I had always wanted.\nThere have been many. To consider the best value for money depends on how much lasting enjoyment or practicality it brings over time, rather than just the price. For me, value comes from how useful or meaningful something is in the long run.\nI don’t regret spending money on anything but I do regret not spending it on one specific thing. Around 2014, I remember laughing at a friend when he recommended I buy a single bitcoin when the price was around €300. It would now be worth about €55,000.\nI don’t typically haggle for day-to-day purchases, but when it comes to more significant buys, I enjoy negotiating to get the best deal.\nNot yet. It’s something I’m definitely interested in doing eventually but I’m the kind of person who would need to study the market thoroughly before taking the plunge.\nDo you have a retirement or pension plan?\nYes, I do have a pension plan that I contribute to. It’s an important part of planning for the future, ensuring I have some security for retirement while I continue to build my business.\nThe last thing I bought was a reMarkable tablet, which helps me keep all my notes organised digitally. Previously I would go through notebook after notebook, so this purchase was definitely worth it in terms of efficiency and reducing paper waste. It’s been great for both business and personal use.\nYes, my wife and I saved up for one of the biggest purchases in our lives – our home. We started building a new home in 2012 and, after four years of hard work and dedication, we completed our self-build project. It was a long process, but incredibly rewarding in the end.\nYes. We once set up a business as a distributor for products from South Korea. It took a significant amount of investment to establish. Unfortunately, the manufacturer suddenly changed its European sales strategy, which effectively shut down our business overnight. It was a tough lesson in the unpredictability of business.\nI wouldn’t call myself a gambler, but I do enjoy placing a small bet a couple of times a year. I’m a big Formula 1 fan and for the 2022 finale, I accidentally added an extra zero to my bet. Luckily, it was on Max Verstappen, so I ended up with a nice little win!\nMy best habit would be my diligence when it comes to big purchases. I’ll do a lot of homework before I commit to a big spend. On the flip side, my worst habit is probably my complete lack of the same when it comes to lower-value items.\n€50 and a debit card.\nIn conversation with Tony Clayton-Lea"]}

This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies … [That] should, all else being equal, dampen both volatility and downside.\"\nThe market for options contracts on major ETFs can be extremely active, and are widely used by more sophisticated traders. For example, over the past five business days, Interactive Brokers clients have more options orders on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) than for the funds themselves, according to data from the brokerage.\nThe launch of the bitcoin ETF options will likely also lead to new funds that incorporate those options, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas.\n\"Grayscale already did a filing for a covered call [fund], and I'm sure BlackRock will come out with it too. And then we're going to get buffers, and then we're going to get whatever other trend-following-type strategy that folks think of. I think the ecosystem's really going to start to fly here,\" Sohn said.\nSpot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January and have been hailed as the most successful ETF launches in history.\nOther bitcoin ETFs are expected to have options available as soon as this week. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the rule changes filed by the New York Stock Exchange, which lists the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and Cboe Global Markets, which lists the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).","19th Nov, 2024. 04:31 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Jan 17, 2024\nAs of Nov 19, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $91677.48.

At the moment, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.392 and many analysts believe that if Bitcoin rallies further, DOGE is likely to see much larger gains for retail investors to get back into the market.\npic.twitter.com\/QkYUe6vxQV\n— Dogecoin (@dogecoin) November 13, 2024\nStellar (XLM)\nAnother altcoin that has attracted recent attention is Stellar (XLM), trading around the price of $0.12. Stellar’s technology fits naturally into today’s world as it is built on a system that facilitates cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. XLM will profit from Bitcoin’s price surge, as the investment attraction to alternative cryptocurrencies with practical applications beyond speculative trading rises.\nVeChain (VET)\nLast on our list of promising altcoins under $1 is VeChain (VET). VeChain is now priced at roughly $0.025 and focuses on supply chain management and logistics through blockchain technology. Its partnerships with key companies illustrate its utility as well as its potential for widespread adoption across all industries. Growing interest in Bitcoin paves the way for more investors to take an interest in VET as well for solid projects with real-world applications. In addition, political changes in the United States following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent presidential election bolster the current pro-crypto environment.

Earlier, it traded as high as $94,989.99.\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy jumped 10%, bringing its week-to-date gains to 39%.\nBitcoin has been regularly hitting fresh records since the election, though in smaller increments since the postelection rally faded last week, on hopes that Trump will usher in a crypto-friendly era for the industry that includes more supportive regulation and a potential national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile.\nTraders this week are keeping a close eye on Trump's appointments for Treasury Secretary and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair.\n\"We're still very much in a phase of kind of pricing in the Trump trade,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\nHe also pointed to the \"mainstream, institutional adoption that we're getting by way of the approval of the bitcoin and ETH spot ETFs this year\" and options trading on those ETFs going live beginning Tuesday, which he called \"another reflection of the maturation of the crypto market.\"\nOptions on BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) began trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) are expected to have options available Wednesday.\nElsewhere, traders are looking forward to Nvidia earnings after the bell, which could affect bitcoin's price. The cryptocurrency often benefits from moves in risk assets broadly, more so this year as institutional investors have become more comfortable with it thanks to bitcoin ETFs.","Bitcoin passed $94,000 for the first time following reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s media company could be close to buying a cryptocurrency trading platform. Additionally, earlier this week, several Bitcoin ETFs began trading on the Nasdaq, offering investors a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the leading cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $94,891, bringing its market capitalization to a record $1.87 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThe recent rally, which has seen Bitcoin add 37% to its value in just one month, could be longer lived as the cryptocurrency becomes less volatile. That’s in large part because of the rise of institutional traders getting in on Bitcoin in recent years, Bobby Zagotta, chief executive of Bitstamp U.S., told MarketWatch.\n“The positions that institutions take are usually more research-based and may have a slightly longer time frame of reference,” he said.\nSince his election win, Trump has also helped give the wider crypto market a boost. Investors have become increasingly optimistic that Trump’s return to the White House in January will bring legitimacy to the digital asset. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to set up a national Bitcoin reserve and accepted donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana.\nIn September, Trump launched a new cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, in partnership with longtime business associates. The venture is seen as a strategic step to capitalize on his growing influence in the digital asset industry.\nAnd Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry could continue to deepen. The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported Tuesday that Trump Media — the company behind Trump’s social media platform Truth Social — is nearing a deal to acquire cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt (ICE).\nBased in Alpharetta, Georgia, Bakkt was established by Intercontinental Exchange, which holds a 55% ownership stake. ICE is also the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. The company has a market cap of $398.74 million.\nIn its third-quarter earnings report earlier this month, Trump Media reported that it lost $19.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, with revenue falling 5.6% to just $1.01 million from a year earlier.\n— Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","20th Nov, 2024. 04:07 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Feb 8, 2024\nAs of Nov 20, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stood at $93033.58.

Ripple (XRP) is expected to hit $8.30 while Solana (SOL) is expected to spike to $714. But one of the most fascinating tales comes from Rexas Finance (RXS), which, at its present presale price of $0.080 as of writing, is poised for a parabolic ascent to $11—a startling 13,650%. Rexas Finance bridges the gap between tangible assets like real estate, gold, and art with the digital world, therefore transforming real-world asset (RWA) tokenization from a token to a revolution.

Nestled in the nexus of blockchain and tangible assets, Rexas Finance’s RWA tokenizing system lets users easily tokenize, fractionalize, and trade actual assets. This innovative strategy accesses markets including real estate, valued at $379.7 trillion, and commodities including gold, valued at $121.2 trillion. Features like the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Launchpad let users tokenize assets without any programming experience and generate money for their initiatives. Supporting criteria including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, Rexas Finance guarantees fit with the larger blockchain environment. Currently shown on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has become somewhat well-known and credible. Comparatively to its expected debut price of $0.20 in early 2025 and its estimated ascent to $11 within the same year, its presale price of $0.080 is a deal. Today’s $100 investment might grow to be $13,650—an ROI unparalleled by Solana or Ripple.\nImage by special arrangement\nCertik Audit, Tier-1 Exchanges, and $1 Million Giveaway\nAt Rexas Finance, community, and security form the center. A Certik audit has confirmed the security of the platform, therefore providing investors with a piece of security. Furthermore guarantees community involvement with its goal via its community-first approach, which avoids venture financing to establish a devoted group of individual investors. Excitement has been raised even further by the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway with 227,543 entries as of writing. 20 winners will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000 each, which offers an amazing incentive for fresh investors. Rexas Finance promises liquidity and accessibility for its expanding customer base, having intentions to open on three out of the top 10 Tier-1 exchanges.

Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content.\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nBitcoin has been on a meteoric rise in 2024, reaching a new all-time high of $93,495 on Wednesday, November 13. As the flagship cryptocurrency inches closer to the $100,000 mark, investors and analysts are debating: will Bitcoin hit this target by the end of this year?\nThe crypto community is abuzz with cautious optimism. Institutional support, favorable political developments on the back of Donald Trump's election win including the promise to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and strong market fundamentals are fueling bullish sentiments. However, concerns over market structure, potential short-term corrections, and timeline uncertainties temper the enthusiasm.\nOne of the most significant factors propelling Bitcoin's surge is the influx of investment. Financial giants like BlackRock have not only added Bitcoin to their balance sheets but have also initiated Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), attracting record inflows of $2.6 billion shortly after the U.S. election.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Bitcoin: What It Is, How It Works, and How To Invest\n\"If you take into account the fact that large companies like BlackRock and other major financial institutions are holding the asset on their balance sheets, this is a much different reality than any other previous cycles for the asset,\" J.D. Seraphine, CEO of crypto-based AI validation platform Raiinmaker, told Newsweek.\nThe approval and adoption of Bitcoin ETFs have provided traditional investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency market. This institutional endorsement is seen as a validation of Bitcoin's legitimacy and long-term potential.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Guide to Cryptocurrency Scams and How To Avoid Them\nOf course, the recent presidential victory for Trump has been viewed as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin's price trajectory. Many in the crypto industry anticipate that a Trump administration will usher in more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\"Trump's victory has certainly accelerated price movement in the cycle,\" Seraphine noted. \"There certainly is a great deal of hype surrounding Trump coming into office and creating regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency in the U.S.\"\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Best Investment Apps\nGabriele Giancola, CEO of Qiibee, echoed this sentiment, saying to Newsweek: \"Bitcoin's performance historically aligns with significant geopolitical and economic events, and the aftermath of the U.S. election could see BTC reaching $100,000 this year or shortly after a potential Trump reelection.\"\nThis is even inspiring other politicians globally to get in on Bitcoin. Polish presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has pledged to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve if he wins the 2025 election.\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that political developments alone will sustain Bitcoin's rally. Lorien Gamaroff, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin wallet and payment platform Centbee, cautioned against over-reliance on political figures. \"But can the crypto community afford to put its hopes in a leader whose track record is filled with broken promises?\" he wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.\nBitcoin's reduced issuance rate due to the recent halving event has tightened supply, while demand continues to grow. A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward that miners earn for creating new blocks of Bitcoin is cut in half. This happens roughly every four years or after 210,000 blocks are mined.\nTrading volumes have reached record highs, and volatility has decreased compared to previous bull runs, indicating a more mature market. Historical patterns suggest that once Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high, it often experiences significant gains.\n\"If you study the price history of BTC, it follows a very predictable pattern,\" Seraphine explained. \"Once it crosses the previous all-time high, it historically hits levels multiples above that previous all-time high.\"\nDespite the bullish indicators, experts warn of potential factors that could slow or reverse this growth. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, posted on X last week: \"Leverage needs to be cleaned up before an attack on $100K. Please manage your risk carefully.\"\nThese caveats aside, Marszalek is all in. \"All nations should sell their useless gold reserves and buy bitcoin,\" he posted on November 15.\nHowever, a large options expiry of $11.8 billion on December 27 could introduce volatility and affect price dynamics, according to BNC. This is the date when cryptocurrency options contracts—derivatives that give traders the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a specific price—reach their expiration date.\nGiancola pointed out the possibility of a short-term correction: \"With the rapid price increases we've witnessed recently, a short-term correction within the next one-two months is plausible.\" However, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects: \"That said, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains extremely strong.\"\nWhile the consensus leans toward Bitcoin eventually reaching $100,000, experts are divided on the timeline. Predictions range from hitting the mark by the end of 2024 to early 2025.\nWhile there's strong agreement on Bitcoin eventually reaching $100,000, there's a split between those who see it happening in 2024 versus early 2025. Most experts emphasize this is more about \"when\" rather than \"if,\" but caution about potential corrections along the way.\nThe sentiment appears to be that, while short-term volatility and corrections are likely, the fundamental and institutional factors supporting Bitcoin's growth are stronger than in previous cycles.\nMarie Boran is a Newsweek reporter based in Carlow, Ireland.

Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 Thursday.\nThe software-company-turned-bitcoin-play disclosed earlier this week it purchased another 51,780 bitcoins for approximately $4.6 billion in cash at an average price of just over $88,500 per bitcoin. The company has acquired a total of 331,200 bitcoins for $16.5 billion, spending an average of 49,874 per bitcoin.\nThis stock surge, however, has caught the attention of investors who see this meteoric move in 2024 as potentially unsustainable.\nIn a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has \"completely detached from BTC fundamentals.\"\n\"Bitcoin is dramatically beating the 'Magnificent Seven,'\" MicroStrategy chair Michael Saylor said in the company's most recent earnings call in October, adding, \"Your best hope to actually keep up with the Magnificent Seven is constructive bitcoin strategy.\"\nRead more: Bitcoin clears another record: Is this a good time to invest?\nThe company, in recent years, adopted bitcoin as its primary Treasury reserve asset through investments funded by equity, debt financing, and its own cash flows under the leadership of Michael Saylor, who served as CEO until 2022 before assuming the role of chairman.\nMicroStrategy began investing in bitcoin in 2020 with what now seems like a measly $250 million investment.\n\"We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of institutional bitcoin adoption,\" CFO Andrew Kang said in the company's Oct. 30 earnings call.\nSaylor added, \"If you've been following our journey, you know that our thesis was bitcoin is like the Facebook of money or the Google of money. It is the dominant digital monetary network.\"\nAs Yahoo Finance’s Josh Schafer reported earlier in November, other crypto-related stocks, such as Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD), have been on an upward trajectory since Trump’s victory as part of the so-called Trump trade.\nThe president-elect has made promises to the industry, including the appointment of a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a \"strategic national bitcoin stockpile.\" In July, Trump also attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville in a signal of his friendliness to the sector.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.\nJosh Schafer contributed reporting.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","Global stock markets saw a slight uptick on Thursday, as investors digested projections from Nvidia and anticipated Bitcoin's approaching $100,000 milestone. The world's leading chipmaker Nvidia initially peaked early in the session but finished with just a 0.53% rise following its forecast for slowest revenue growth in seven quarters.\nIn a volatile session on Wall Street, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all ended higher, fueled by gains in the utilities, financials, and consumer staples sectors despite a drag from communication services stock, particularly Alphabet's decline. Regulatory pressures mount as U.S. prosecutors urge for Alphabet's Chrome divesture to dismantle Google's search monopoly.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin soared closer to the $100,000 threshold, bolstered by Donald Trump's election victory and expectations of a favorable cryptocurrency stance by his administration. Simultaneously, the dollar showed mixed movements on currency markets, reflecting labor market resilience and Federal Reserve interest rate pathways.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n© Copyright 2025","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nOn Thursday, bitcoin’s price soared past $99,000 for the first time in its history, setting a new all-time high for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\nMarket analysts predict the upward trajectory will continue in the coming weeks, with bitcoin likely crossing the $100,000 milestone even before President-Elect Donald Trump takes office in January.\n“In the last 2-3 weeks, bitcoin has consistently reached new highs and is now approaching the critical psychological threshold of $100,000,” said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX, a crypto prime brokerage, in an interview with TheStreet Crypto.\n“What’s less discussed is that these sharp price increases are supported by exceptionally high trading volumes,” Lawant noted. “For context, bitcoin has been trading over $25 billion daily on the spot market — often surpassing $40 billion — compared to $10-12 billion on a strong day just a few months ago. Notably, all five of bitcoin’s highest-volume trading days occurred in 2024. While trading volumes for other assets, except Solana, have also risen, they remain well below the peak levels of the last market cycle.”\nAnalysts suggest that Trump’s presidency has already been a boon for digital assets, with many anticipating that his second term will bring policies favoring the cryptocurrency sector. The market received another jolt of optimism on Thursday when Gary Gensler, the Biden-appointed chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (SEC) announced his resignation. Speculation about Trump’s forthcoming SEC appointee has only added to bitcoin’s bullish momentum.\nThe price of bitcoin is currently trading at $98,000 at the time of writing.","NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed after market superstar Nvidia and another round of companies said they’re making even fatter profits than expected.

From meme-worthy origins to Elon Musk connections, these coins showcase the diverse opportunities AI-based tokens offer investors.\nHere’s a closer look at these coins, their stories, and their potential:\nBackstory:Created accidentally by an AI named “Truth Terminal,” Gosias Maximus started as a Twitter experiment funded by Mark Andreessen, who donated $50,000 in Bitcoin. The AI-generated token has since become a cultural phenomenon.\nMarket Insights:\nAll-Time High: Hit over $1.30.\nCurrent Price: Around $0.17 after a 30% pullback.\nWhy It’s Worth Watching: Meme coins are no longer capped at $1 billion market caps. With Dogecoin and Shiba Inu pushing multi-billion-dollar valuations, GOAT could follow suit, potentially reaching $10 to $20 billion in market cap.\nKey Takeaway:Meme coins are evolving, and GOAT’s community-driven narrative combined with its AI origins makes it a prime candidate for the next big move.\nBackstory:ACT represents the next phase of AI crypto, focusing on utility and volume. Despite recent controversy surrounding its developers selling tokens, ACT continues to draw significant interest.\nMarket Insights:\nPullback: Down 33% from its high.\nVolume: $1.5 billion in trading volume, dwarfing competitors.\nWhy It’s Worth Watching: High volume often signals whale accumulation and potential exchange listings.\nKey Takeaway:With its impressive trading volume and potential for future listings, ACT is positioned to break out as the AI narrative continues to gain traction.\nBackstory:FACT, the first token coded by Elon Musk’s AI, Grok, is a true underdog with a quirky name and a devoted community. Its low market cap and speculative ties to Musk have fueled interest.\nMarket Insights:\nMarket Cap: Just $10 million.\nPullback: Down 54%, offering a potential entry point.\nElon Musk Speculation: FACT was created during a private Grok test, leading to rumors of Musk’s involvement.\nWhy It’s Worth Watching:With consistent higher lows forming a potential bull flag, FACT could see a significant breakout. On the log chart, the token shows a potential for a 10x gain, while a more conservative prediction places it at a 2x from current levels.\nKey Takeaway:FACT’s micro-cap status and Elon Musk association make it a high-risk, high-reward play with unique appeal.\nAs AI continues to dominate conversations in the crypto space, these coins represent three distinct opportunities:\nGOAT for meme coin enthusiasts aiming for large-cap gains.\nACT for mid-cap stability and strong trading volume.\nFACT for micro-cap thrill seekers with a taste for speculative plays.\nThe AI narrative is heating up, and the next run could be transformational. With meme coins leading the way and utility-focused tokens catching up, this sector is poised for explosive growth.\nWill you join the AI coin revolution or watch from the sidelines? Let us know which coins you’re betting on—and we’ll see you and the robot overlords at the top.","Bitcoin’s rally shows no signs of slowing, with the leading cryptocurrency surging past the $98,000 mark to hit a new all-time high. According to data from the crypto tracking platform CoinGecko, Bitcoin reached $98,831 on Thursday, setting a historic milestone.\nThis remarkable ascent follows the debut of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) options earlier this week—a landmark event in the cryptocurrency industry. The launch of these options represents a pivotal moment, as it bridges the gap between the decentralized world of digital assets and traditional finance. By offering institutional investors—or the so-called “big fish”—a more familiar and regulated way to access Bitcoin, these ETFs are expected to drive further adoption and liquidity in the market.\nBitcoin’s continued strength highlights its growing appeal among a broader range of investors, cementing its position as a key player in the evolving global financial landscape. The Bitcoin rally that gained momentum following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory is not going to slow down. Market analysts and enthusiasts alike suggest that the cryptocurrency’s ascent to the highly anticipated $100,000 milestone now appears not just achievable but potentially imminent.\nBitcoin’s rally is lifting the broader cryptocurrency market, with several leading digital assets also experiencing significant upward momentum. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $3,300, marking an impressive 7% surge in the past 24 hours.\nOther major players are riding the wave as well. Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have all recorded gains within the 2%-3% range over the same period.\nThis widespread market uptick highlights the interconnected nature of the crypto space, where Bitcoin often sets the pace for other digital assets. As enthusiasm builds across the board, these altcoins are drawing increased attention from investors eager to capitalize on the bullish sentiment sweeping the market.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."]}

According to global investment firm, Bitcoin is likely to hit $200,000 in the year 2025 after Donald Trump takes over the charge and an ambitious $1 million by 2030.\nTrump’s victory in the US presidential election 2024 has sparked huge optimism in cryptocurrencies as the president-elect is expected to have crypto-friendly policies during his tenure. The Bitcoin Bill, along with Pennsylvania’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, is expected to gain momentum during Trump’s presidency.\n“The bill (Bitcoin Bill) is creating widespread excitement as it could set up Bitcoin for an over $1 million valuation,\" said Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, according to cointelegraph.com.\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood also expects Bitcoin to hit $1 million by 2030, according to Yahoo Finance.\nGlobal investment firm Bernstein in its latest report said Bitcoin could be headed for the stratosphere. It predicts Bitcoin to touch $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million per token by 2033.\nBitcoin Price Today: Volumes Surge\nOver the past two to three weeks, Bitcoin has been on an upward trajectory, consistently hitting new price peaks and now approaching the highly anticipated $100,000 psychological threshold, said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX.\nThis sharp price increase is being driven by exceptionally high trading volumes, with Bitcoin regularly trading over $25 billion daily on the spot market, and at times exceeding $40 billion. This marks a significant jump from the $10-12 billion in daily volume seen just a few months ago, underscoring the growing market interest and investor confidence, he added.\n“The recent surge has been further fueled by developments in the U.S. political landscape. Digital assets have already benefitted from the incoming administration of President Trump, with many anticipating that his potential second term could bring more favorable regulatory policies for the crypto sector. Adding to the optimism, the recent resignation of the SEC Chair appointed by President Biden, has sparked speculation about his successor. Market participants are hopeful that the new SEC leadership could bring a more crypto-friendly approach, further boosting investor sentiment and fueling Bitcoin’s bullish momentum,\" Gupta said.\nAccording to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough crypto stance, plans to leave the commission entirely on January 20 if Trump takes office, potentially reshaping regulatory dynamics.\nSolana (SOL) has hit a record high above $260, fueled by ETF-related optimism, while XRP surged 25% as regulatory clarity eased headwinds for Ripple. In contrast, MicroStrategy’s stock tumbled 16%, with investors questioning its valuation despite Bitcoin’s rally.\n‘Several Cryptos Facing Headwinds’\nWith a growing influx of capital into spot BTC ETFs and a market cap now surpassing $1.9 trillion, Bitcoin continues to strengthen its position, accounting for 58% of the total crypto market.\nSwipe Left For Next Video\n“While many altcoins are facing headwinds, particularly meme coins like PEPE and DOGE, Bitcoin’s strength is clearly drawing a clearer line between quality assets and speculative plays,\" said Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42.\nAs the world’s largest crypto approaches the critical $100,000 milestone, the market’s focus is shifting toward Bitcoin as the dominant force.","22nd Nov, 2024. 03:34 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO PKR – Today’s Bitcoin price in Pakistan on Feb 10, 2024\nThe rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 27361831.34 on 22 Nov 2024.\n1 BTC = 27361831.34 Pakistani rupees.\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly due to various factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends.

The benchmark index’s 1.7% gain for the week erased most of its loss from last week.\nRecommended Videos\nThe Dow rose 1% as it nudged past its most recent high set last week, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%.\nMarkets have been volatile over the last few weeks, losing ground in the runup to elections in November, then surging following Donald Trump's victory, before falling again. The S&P 500 has been steadily rising throughout this week to within close range of its record. It's now within about 0.5% of its all-time high set last week.\n“Overall, market behavior has normalized following an intense few weeks,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a statement.\nSeveral retailers jumped after giving Wall Street encouraging financial updates.\nGap soared 12.8% after handily beating analysts' third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, while raising its own revenue forecast for the year. Discount retailer Ross Stores rose 2.2% after raising its earnings forecast for the year.\nEchoStar fell 2.8% after DirecTV called off its purchase of that company's Dish Network unit.\nSmaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index rose 1.8%.\nA majority of stocks in the S&P 500 gained ground, but those gains were kept in check by slumps for several big technology companies.\nNvidia fell 3.2%. Its pricey valuation makes it among the heaviest influences on whether the broader market gains or loses ground.

It has more than doubled this year and first surpassed the $99,000 level on Thursday.\nRetailers remained a big focus for investors this week amid close scrutiny on consumer spending habits headed into the holiday shopping season. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, reported a quarter of strong sales and gave investors an encouraging financial forecast. Target, though, reported weaker earnings than analysts' expected and its forecast disappointed Wall Street.\nConsumer spending has fueled economic growth, despite a persistent squeeze from inflation and high borrowing costs. Inflation has been easing and the Federal Reserve has started trimming its benchmark interest rates. That is likely to help relieve pressure on consumers, but any major shift in spending could prompt the Fed to reassess its path ahead on interest rates. Also, any big reversals on the rate of inflation could curtail spending.\nConsumer sentiment remains strong, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index. It revised its latest figure for November to 71.8 from an initial reading of 73 earlier this month, though economists expected a slight increase. It's still up from 70.5 in October.\nThe survey also showed that consumers' inflation expectations for the year ahead fell slightly to 2.6%, which is the lowest reading since December of 2020.\nWall Street will get another update on how consumers feel when the business group The Conference Board releases its monthly consumer confidence survey on Tuesday.\nA key inflation update will come on Wednesday when the U.S. releases its October personal consumption expenditures index.

But that was precisely why the world's largest cryptocurrency was valuable.\nIt was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn't get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin's core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That's why many of crypto's more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications.\nThe approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn't really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo.\nBut times are changing for the original coin.\nDevelopers are increasingly building on bitcoin's base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets.\nIn January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2.\nCreating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they're investing.\nCollectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year.\nNearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September.\nVetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools.\nLunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares' BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs.\nGalaxy Digital's trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock's IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock's bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust.\nOptions on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands.\nGalaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump's administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5.\n\"This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF's long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead,\" Galaxy's trading team told CNBC.\nUntil now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading.\nOn Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches.\n\"There's a ton of leverage in the system right now,\" Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday.\n\"You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they've been, the basis is high,\" Novogratz said. \"The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.\"\nBitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000.","The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as Bitcoin hovers tantalizingly close to the elusive $100,000 milestone.\nFor many investors and enthusiasts, breaking that threshold feels less like a question of if and more a matter of when. Last week, Bitcoin flirted with six figures, surging to a record $99,645. Since then, it has taken a slight pause, as if gathering its strength for the final push toward the six-figure mark.\nMeanwhile, investors have been flocking to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a growing embrace of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. On November 21 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a staggering net inflow of over $1 billion, followed by an additional half a billion dollars on November 22, according to ETF tracker Farside. These inflows highlight a surging demand for direct exposure to Bitcoin, particularly through vehicles designed for institutional and mainstream investors.\nAdding to the momentum, the introduction of options trading on Bitcoin ETFs has also captured significant attention. On November 19, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) made headlines when its newly launched options market recorded an impressive $1.9 billion in trading volume on its first day. This milestone underscores the rapid adoption of Bitcoin-focused financial products and reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional markets.\nThese developments underscore the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset class, while also highlighting the expanding influence of institutional players in reshaping the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The convergence of rising demand, innovative financial products, and heightened investor confidence make it increasingly likely that Bitcoin will soon break through the $100,000 mark — a historic milestone that could redefine the narrative around digital assets and their role in global finance.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","This is not investment advice.

However prices have since taken a breather, and bitcoin was trading around $98,243.25 early Monday, according to CoinGecko data — up only a fraction of a percent on the day.\nCNBC asked analysts for their take on why bitcoin has so far failed to breach the widely-watched $100,000 mark.\nAndre Dragosch, head of research for Europe at crypto-focused asset management firm Bitwise, said bitcoin was likely being kept below the psychological barrier as investors take profit from its sizable post-election rally.\nBitcoin has \"so far failed to breach\" $100,000 because \"long-term holders have started to distribute significant amounts of bitcoins into the recent rally,\" Dragosch said in a research note shared Monday.\nHe added he expects the bitcoin rally to \"take a break in the short term as sentiment remains elevated and positioning appears to be somewhat stretched.\"\nHowever, \"this could be a bull market correction rather than a change in trend,\" Dragosch said, adding that overall, \"bitcoin valuations are still far away from being excessive.\"\nA squeeze on supply of bitcoin resulting from events such as the so-called \"halving\" earlier this year — which resulted in the issuance of new bitcoin to miners being reduced by half — will continue to support prices heading into 2025, he added.\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset management firm Galaxy Digital, said last week that although he thinks bitcoin reaching the six-figure milestone post-election is \"inevitable,\" a pullback was to be expected.\n\"There's a ton of leverage in the system right now,\" Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.\"\nNovogratz added that he's advocating investors buy \"straight bitcoin\" rather than bitcoin-exposed plays, such as MicroStrategy which owns a huge, multi-billion-dollar pile of bitcoin in its corporate treasury reserves.\nHe also flagged that one unknown seller has been dumping crypto in recent days, which could be pressuring the token's price. \"There had been a giant seller for the last week, between 92, 93 and 94. Probably $14-$15 billion of bitcoin sold there,\" Novogratz said on air.\nDavid Morrison, senior market analyst at brokerage firm Trade Nation, said that although $100,000 is a \"nice round number,\" it \"feels as if it has become a high hurdle, if not a barrier, for further gains.\"\n\"If bitcoin starts to fade from here, that could be all we get — especially if longer term holders decide to cash out early,\" Morrison told CNBC via email.\nNevertheless, he added that there's a \"strong probability that upside momentum can build up enough energy for a surge through here.\"\n\"If so, then that could be the trigger for another push higher,\" Morrison said.\nMarion Laboure, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that although Trump has indicated continued support for bitcoin and the broader crypto industry, any prospect of concrete federal crypto legislation remained some way off.\nPro-crypto pledges by Trump include turning the U.S. into a global crypto hub, forming a strategic national crypto stockpile, and replacing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler — who last week announced he would resign on Jan. 20.\nDeutsche Bank's Laboure said she thinks the idea of a U.S. national bitcoin is still far off, practically speaking.\nMeanwhile, major reforms will \"require congressional approval on time, which makes these ambitious long-term goals more or less achievable, and there is also some potential turbulence of these reforms to fall short of market expectations,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\nNevertheless, Laboure added that she sees regulation as \"a net positive for the industry.\"","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nUpdated at 10:29 AM EST\nMicroStrategy shares turned lower in early Monday trading as bitcoin prices continue to test the $100,000 mark and a pair of Wall Street analysts boosted their price targets on the world's biggest holder of the world's biggest cryptocurrency.\nMicroStrategy shares  (MSTR)  have soared more than 500% so far this year, adding more than $75 billion in market value, as CEO Michael Saylor executed a series of capital raising efforts designed to add to the group's bitcoin holdings.\nBitcoin prices, which have had an enormous comeback this year in the wake of the FTX platform collapse and the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of a spot exchange-traded fund in early January, are up 133% and have come within a whisker of breaching $100,000.\nMicroStrategy, in fact, said in an SEC filing Monday that it purchased 55,000 bitcoin last week at just under $98,000.\n\"Twenty Twenty-four has been a great year,\" Saylor told investors last month. \"The launch of the ETFs at the beginning of the year was a major milestone.

Smart move indeed!","Associate Professor and Director of the Centre on US Politics, UCL\nThomas Gift holds shares in Bitcoin financial instruments.\nUniversity College London apporte des fonds en tant que membre fondateur de The Conversation UK.\nVoir les partenaires de The Conversation France\nBitcoin has soared to an all-time price high, but will it continue? Advocates of the world’s largest cryptocurrency hope its value will continue to soar when Donald Trump returns to the White House.\nAfter the price of bitcoin surged from approximately US$69,000 (£54,000) the day before the election on November 5 to nearly US$100,000 now. Bitcoiners are keeping their eyes focused on what happens next in US politics.\nSmall wonder. As a candidate, Trump pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and said he would back a bitcoin strategic reserve, which would order the US to purchase and hold bitcoin for an indefinite amount of time.\nTrump even suggested that the US might one day pay off its national debt in cryptocurrency. Many of Trump’s future cabinet members and inner circle are reportedly pro-crypto, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he holds “most” of his net worth in bitcoin.\nWith a bullish outlook, other Trump-aligned politicians are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has proposed the Bitcoin Act of 2024, which would increase the stash of US government-owned bitcoin and potentially shore up US supremacy in a budding geopolitical competition to horde the asset.\nThe US holds roughly 203,000 bitcoin, or about US$21 billion, which it has largely accumulated through seizures from illicit holdings.\nIt’s not just Washington getting into the act. In Texas, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, a pro-bitcoin non-profit, recently tweeted that he is in “discussions” to help introduce a bitcoin strategic reserve in the lone star state.\nPennsylvania has also passed a new bitcoin “rights bill” and floated creating a strategic reserve. Some think this is game theory playing out. As states rush to buy bitcoin, it could create a “race to the top” that forces other government entities to join the blockchain.\nAside from politicians’ promises, a number of other reasons explain why many bitcoiners are poising themselves for a Trump-fuelled bull run.\nOne is the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will keep on printing money for the foreseeable future to finance America’s debt, which is currently about US$36 trillion and growing. Because the supply of bitcoin is finite – there will only ever be 21 million mined – it is often considered a hedge against runaway inflation. More available money funnelling into the scarce asset will necessarily drive up bitcoin’s price.\nAlthough numbers vary, one recent analysis by the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump’s economic proposals could balloon the federal debt by up to US$15 trillion over ten years. While leaders of the new Department of Government Efficiency, a consulting group that Trump is planning to create, have promised to “drain the swamp,” sceptics question if that’s possible when spending cuts on debt servicing, defence and entitlements such as social security and Medicare are all off the table. As an expanding supply of total dollars finds its way into finite assets like bitcoin, it becomes more expensive for consumers to buy.\nAnother reason for bitcoin bullishness is that the Trump administration is expected to offer more regulatory clarity over the crypto industry. This doesn’t necessarily mean more deregulation, but rather outlining clearer “rules of the road” for how individuals and firms can trade crypto assets.\nMany bitcoiners, for example, have seen Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler, who once taught a class on blockchain technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as bad for crypto and quick to engage in arbitrary enforcement of SEC regulations.\nGensler will step down down from his role on January 20 of next year, and a new Trump-appointed SEC chairman is likely to be more intent on expanding the crypto sector.\nA final variable pulling the price of bitcoin higher is greater institutional adoption by financial investment advisories and banks, pegged to recent SEC rulings. Earlier this year, after losing a court battle in 2023, the SEC was essentially compelled to approve “spot” bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are investment instruments that track bitcoin’s market price.\nThese ETFs, more readily accessible to corporate as well as individual investors, have brought financial juggernauts such as Fidelity and BlackRock into the bitcoin space, signalling mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, for example, has called bitcoin “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial commodity.\nA looming question about bitcoin is the degree to which it remains a partisan issue. While Republicans have rallied behind bitcoin as part of an economic “freedom” agenda, many high-ranking Democrats have been more hostile. For instance, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has been described as carrying out an “anti-crypocurrency crusade”. However, other Democrats like New York Senator Chuck Schumer have sought to reduce federal restrictions on trading crypto assets.\nRepublicans are trying to exploit their perceived advantage on the issue. Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, has insisted that the “crypto economy is here to stay”.\nMeanwhile, chief executives of major crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jockeying for a seat in Trump’s new proposed crypto council, which will advise the White House on policy related to crypto assets.\nIf 2024 was the “crypto election”, the big unknown is whether Trump will really champion digital assets, or dash the hopes (and wallets) of bitcoiners everywhere.\nÉcrivez un article et rejoignez une communauté de plus de 202 200 universitaires et chercheurs de 5 174 institutions.\nEnregistrez-vous maintenant","Bitcoin’s price fell back to $91,000 Tuesday afternoon as the leading cryptocurrency reversed course on some recent gains following Donald Trump’s election win.\nAfter surpassing $98,000 last week,  the cryptocurrency’s value dropped more than 6% in the past 24 hours. The reversal has temporarily dashed hopes of Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark this week.\nAnd when Bitcoin sinks, other popular digital assets tend to follow suit. Over the last day, Ethereum — the second-largest coin by market capitalization — was down 5%, to $3,300. Solana fell more than 9%, and Elon Musk’s preferred Dogecoin shed almost 12% in value.\nThe wider crypto market has sunk 6.25% in the past day for a $3.16 trillion market cap. Bitcoin has driven much of that, alone having a market value of about $1.8 trillion. That makes it the world’s eighth-largest asset, pulling ahead of silver with a $1.7 trillion market cap. Bitcoin still falls well short of gold, which is valued at $17 trillion.\nBitcoin has been on a rally since Trump, who positioned himself as the “crypto candidate,” won a second term in the White House earlier this month. Bitcoin has gained almost 35% in value since the election.\nThe ascent was accelerated by the debut of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) options last week, which represented a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency industry. These options bridge the gap between the decentralized world of digital assets and traditional finance by offering institutional investors a more familiar and regulated way to access Bitcoin. The ETFs are expected to drive further adoption and liquidity in the market.\nDespite broader acceptance by more traditional investors, the crypto market  remains volatile and can rise rapidly — but retreat just as quickly. That may help to explain why the digital asset has shied away from the long-awaited $100,000 milestone after getting so close last week.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","In this article\nThe price of bitcoin retreated further from the psychological $100,000 milestone, as investors booked profits from the cryptocurrency's gains following the presidential election.\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently lower by more than 4%, at $90,999.30, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it fell as low as $90,702.27. The CoinDesk 20, an index measuring broader cryptocurrency performance, fell 4.78%.\nCoinbase and MicroStrategy, equity market proxies for crypto assets, fell 6% and 12%, respectively.\n\"Bitcoin has been on a tear since Election Day … with very few pullbacks, but the $100,000 mark remains a formidable psychological barrier,\" Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, told CNBC by email. \"While breaking through now would be a major bullish signal, a brief pullback may be needed to gather momentum before the next attempt.\"\nWith bitcoin regularly hitting new records this month, long-term holders have increasingly been selling in the spot market in larger amounts. That selling pressure has so far been absorbed by inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which ended a five-day advance Monday and logged $438 million in outflows, and large purchases by MicroStrategy. CryptoQuant typically defines long-term holders as entities that have held bitcoin for 155 days or more.\nTraders took profits for a second day following bitcoin's postelection rally, which was fueled by optimism about President-elect Donald Trump's pro-crypto policy platform.\n\"Historically, when new all-time highs are reached, there is typically a period of consolidation before further moves up,\" Brett Reeves of Crypto infrastructure firm BitGo told CNBC. \"We know that new institutional money is coming into the space and retail activity is picking up, both via ETFs and exchanges. With positive macro and regulatory news ahead, we could see a quick pick up in price activity.\"\nBitcoin has gained more than 30% since the U.S. election and is up 114% this year.","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, surpassing $94,000 after surging over 120% this year from $40,000. This milestone has revitalized the broader cryptocurrency market, sparking a resurgence in altcoins. Many cryptocurrencies have seen meteoric gains, with some outpacing Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance. The rally highlights the growing diversity within the crypto space as investors increasingly explore opportunities beyond Bitcoin to capitalize on the market’s momentum.\n2 \/ 7\nSolana (SOL) is seen as a strong competitor to the Ethereum blockchain and has witnessed remarkable growth this year, fueled by its high-speed transaction processing and cost-efficient infrastructure. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second has made it an attractive choice for developers and users alike, driving a surge in activity on its network. As a result, Solana has become a popular platform for hosting decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from DeFi projects to NFT marketplaces.\nCurrently, Solana is trading at $233, representing a 130% increase year-to-date.\n3 \/ 7\nThe highly volatile and widely popular memecoin Dogecoin has experienced notable upward momentum throughout the year. A significant catalyst behind its recent surge is its ongoing association with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Known as the self-proclaimed “Dogefather,” Musk has frequently used his social media presence to champion Dogecoin, often sparking price movements with his tweets and public comments.\nThis year, Musk’s open support for former President Donald Trump has added a new layer of intrigue to Dogecoin’s narrative, drawing attention from both crypto enthusiasts and political commentators. The combination of Musk’s influence and the coin’s strong community backing has continued to fuel its unpredictable yet persistent rise, underscoring the unique interplay of celebrity, social media, and cryptocurrency in Dogecoin’s market performance.\nCurrently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.37, representing a 318% increase year-to-date.\n4 \/ 7\nShiba Inu is Dogecoin’s main rival and another popular memecoin that has a position among the major cryptocurrencies. If you’d invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) in November 2020 for $100, you would have earned a mind-boggling return of 41831154% today – which means a whopping $41,831,254.\nCurrently, Shiba Inu is trading at 0.000023, representing a 134% growth year-to-date.\n5 \/ 7\nThe meteoric rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has paved the way for other memecoins to gain prominence, notably Pepe, a frog-themed cryptocurrency. Riding the wave of memecoin popularity, Pepe has quickly climbed the ranks, now securing a spot among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\nThis ascent reflects a broader trend where humor, internet culture, and community-driven enthusiasm play a pivotal role in shaping market dynamics. Pepe’s success underscores how memecoins, once dismissed as novelties, have evolved into a significant segment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, attracting both retail and institutional interest.\nCurrently, Pepe is trading at $0.000019, representing a 1,766% growth year-to-date.\n6 \/ 7\nMantra (OM) (OM) is a specialized blockchain network dedicated to the issuance, trading, and secure management of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

Growth was slowing and the tiny company had just missed its Q3 revenue and earnings targets. Wall Street punished the stock, sending it 80% lower, as it was caught in the Nasdaq downdraft of early 2022 over inflationary fears and Fed tightening. Then in 2023, after $800 million of its $1 billion market cap had already evaporated, Medicare Advantage announced changes threatening reimbursement for its core product, QuantaFlo, software sold to doctors that detects signs of peripheral arterial disease during a five minute office visit. QuantFlo accounts for more than 80% of Semler’s $68 million in annual revenues.\nSemler Scientific’s stock was in a deep rut, so the company brought in Eric Semler, son of the founder and activist hedge fund manager from New York City’s TCS Capital Management, known for rattling the cages of companies like Angie’s List, Yelp and Nielsen\/Net Rating. His solution? Use its cash to buy bitcoin.\n“We had to figure out how to maximize the value of our cash and stock,”says Semler, 59, now Chairman of the board, who described his family company as a zombie. “There were no promising acquisition targets, and a stock buyback was not preferred because the company already had a small float and was thinly traded, so there was no reason to make the float smaller.”\nIn May 2024, with software company-turned-bitcoin fund, MicroStrategy, as its model, Semler unveiled its own Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, with a goal of “potential returns, diversification and inflation hedging.” The company would use its $60-plus million in balance sheet cash, plus the proceeds of a stock offering managed by Cantor Fitzgerald to purchase bitcoin.\nIn the last six months Semler has accumulated 1,570 tokens worth $149 million at an average price of $75,000. Its bitcoin gains amount to $31 million for 2024, which is 50% greater than the company’s net income of $20.6 million for 2023. Like MicroStrategy ‘s billionaire CEO Michael Saylor, Semler has even gone as far as touting his company’s recent BTC Yield of 58.4%, a dubious measure of the percentage change in the ratio of its bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares of common stock.\nSemler’s stock is up 112% since the company began buying bitcoin in May, more than triple bitcoin’s 34% price appreciation over the same period. And like software company MicroStrategy, whose stock is up 3,150% since it embarked on its bitcoin buying spree in 2020, and 538% year-to-date, Semler says he isn't giving up on medical devices, “We're very committed to our medical business. We believe that it has good potential,” say Semler. Still, Semler, who is running TCS Capital, is devoting plenty of his time these days courting crypto fans in Youtube interviews, podcasts and appearing at crypto events.\nSemler Scientific is part of a wave of small public companies looking to infuse their sagging stocks with the pixie dust fueling the current bull market in crypto, in the same way $90 billion (market cap) MicroStrategy has by hoarding bitcoin. In crypto markets valuations, are driven as much by faith as they are by fundamentals. Dogecoin, a so-called meme token whose logo is a Shiba Inu dog, has a market capitalization of $60 billion, up 200% in the last 30 days. It is a symptom of irrational exuberance reminiscent of the dotcom craze of 1998 and 1999, when every type of company, from Pets.com to Boo.com and eToys.com, was adding “.com” to their names and phrases like the “world wide web” to their mission statements. Virtually all of these bubble stocks collapsed when internet stocks crashed in 2000.\nJapan-based Metaplanet is another convert to the MicroStrategy playbook. “His [Saylor’s] ability to articulate Bitcoin's role as a superior reserve asset and a hedge against monetary debasement resonated deeply with me,” says Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, from Tokyo. “Additionally, his willingness to share his playbook, from capital-raising techniques to the intricacies of navigating Bitcoin accounting, gave us the confidence to tailor a similar strategy for Metaplanet, particularly in Japan's unique economic landscape.”\nIn the beginning of 2024, Metaplanet desperately needed a reset. Originally set up as a real estate company with $34 million in assets and focused on hotels, the company faced an existential crisis when the covid pandemic hit. “During COVID, Japan's decision to close its borders caused our hotel business revenue to drop to almost zero overnight,” he says. “The abrupt revenue loss revealed our model’s vulnerability to such disruptions.” Its stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange had fallen by 85% from 2020 to the beginning of 2024.\nGerovich decided that hotels were too risky and he needed to go digital. “By pivoting to Bitcoin, we transitioned from a business model vulnerable to externalities to one built around an asset that is decentralized, resilient, and aligned with the trends of a digital-first global economy,” says Gerovich\nSo beginning in April, Metaplanet raised more than $70 million through loans, stock sales to existing shareholders, and private placements and began buying bitcoin in the open market. So far in 2024 the company has purchased 1,142 bitcoin for and is sitting on gains of about $30 million. Each open market purchase is accompanied by press releases trumpeting the buys and Gerovich has been a fixture on the bitcoin conference circuit, including an appearance in Nashville at Bitcoin2024, where former President Trump was a headliner. Metaplanet’s stock has been a rocket. It’s shares, which are traded in yen, are up 1,571% so far year, its shareholder base has exploded from 5,000 to 50,000 and its market cap is $612 million.\nMetaplanet has gone even further in corporate makeover than Semler Scientific or MicroStrategy. It has sold off every property but one hotel and used the proceeds to fund its crypto purchases. Another driver in Metaplanet’s stock surge has been Japanese laws which discourage investing directly in crypto, because it is taxed at ordinary income rates, which are as high as 55% says Gerovich. Capital gains from owning Metaplanet’s stock would be taxed at a 20% rate.\nSays Gerovich, “By aligning our corporate strategy with Bitcoin, we’ve created a tax-efficient vehicle for individuals and institutions seeking exposure to bitcoin without facing the punitive tax implications of direct ownership.”\nSingapore’s Genius Group, is another tiny public company chasing bitcoin riches. In the last few weeks it has gone from an edtech startup using AI to “a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education and acceleration group.”\nHere is Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton’s explanation of its latest pivot:\n“2025 will be the year that we see the clear beginning of a major collapse [in the U.S. dollar]. It also happens to be the year that we have Elon Musk and Sam Altman saying that we could be expecting artificial general intelligence. The two of them are interrelated. The moment you've got something faster or smarter than human intelligence on the planet, and they're creating their monetary system, they will adopt Bitcoin. That’s my bet.”\nGenius announced its bitcoin treasury strategy on November 12th and made its first bitcoin purchase of 110 bitcoin for $10 million on November 18th, at an average price of $91,372.\nIt’s already paid off. It’s micro-cap stock surged 150% on the NYSE’s Arca after the announcement , and while it has pulled back, it still is up 40% , giving it a market capitalization of nearly $16 million. Hamilton says his goal is to obtain 1,000 bitcoin, which would equate to a $1 billion treasury if bitcoin reaches $100,000.\nIt’s an ambitous goal, considering the company lost $5.7 million on $23 million in revenues in 2023. Outside of any bitcoin profits, its likely to have losses again in 2024.\n“Our focus is not going knocking on the doors of investors in Manhattan,” says Hamilton, “Our focus is going to the Bitcoin community and saying, look, here is a way for you to outperform Bitcoin because you're buying something that has the same value growth but has a value add layer on top of it, which is what we are doing with education.”\nM\nore bitcoin bandwagon joiners will surface as the benchmark cryptocurrency’s price approaches $100,000. In the past week alone, three money-losing micro-cap stocks, Chicago’s Cosmos Health, Los Angeles-based Thumzup Media Corp and Solidion Technology, a battery maker in Dallas, all announced plans to add bitcoin to their balance sheets.\n“I meet with companies all the time, always asking them about buying bitcoin,” says Semler, 8.5% owner of his company, whose market cap has more than doubled to $445 million under his new bitcoin buying plan. “I'd like to see more companies do it, but they just still kind of laugh at you.”"]}

Well, this cryptocurrency has followed a very predictable pattern during the past decade. And this historical pattern suggests what's in store for 2025.\nBitcoin is a digital currency and transactions are consequently digital as well. Therefore, the system requires computers to process transactions. And independent third parties use their equipment to voluntarily do this. The process is called mining and they volunteer their services because they're paid in Bitcoin.\nHow much do Bitcoin miners get paid? Without going too deep in the weeds, the protocol establishes a certain amount of pay for a certain amount of work. But about every four years, the payments get cut in half. This is known as the Bitcoin halving event.\nI'll momentarily explain why the halving event has historically affected Bitcoin's price -- that's the more important thing to take away from this discussion. But for now, allow me to simply explain how the halving event has affected the price.\nThe table below shows the returns for Bitcoin during the calendar year two years before the halving, the year right before the halving, the year of the halving, and the year immediately after a halving. As you can see, the historical pattern is quite clear.\nBitcoin Halving Year\n2 Years Before\nYear Before\nYear of\nYear After\n2016\n(15%)\n34%\n124%\n1,369%\n2020\n(73%)\n92%\n303%\n60%\n2024\n(64%)\n155%\n132%*\nTBD\nPercentage return data from StatMuse. *Returns as of 11\/25\/24, according to YCharts.\nWhen it comes to the regular cycle, Bitcoin has made big gains the year before, the year of, and the year after a halving event. The other year of the four-year cycle represents a down year.\nBecause of the pattern shown in the table above, one would expect Bitcoin to have a great year in 2025 even though it already reached all-time highs in 2024. Consequently, it doesn't seem like a sell-off is imminent.\nThe problem with historical patterns is that they're devilishly deceptive. In reality, investors can never assume that the future will always look like the past. We know this to be true as evidenced by our English word for this phenomena: unprecedented.\n\"Unprecedented\" is what we say when something that hasn't happened before actually happens. Historical patterns go out the window when a precedent is broken.\nIn other words, one would expect Bitcoin to go up in 2025 because the historical trend says the price goes up during the calendar year after the Bitcoin halving. But there's always room for an unprecedented drop.\nIn my opinion, the reason returns for Bitcoin have been so predictable historically is because the supply and demand dynamics are predictable. Every four years, the new supply of Bitcoin through mining is cut in half. This disrupts the balance between new supply and new demand, leading to big jumps in price. But demand (often through crypto FOMO) eventually catches back up, leading to sell-offs.\nThe thing is, Bitcoin's protocol only controls the supply of coins in a predictable way. It can't control demand, meaning that half of the equation has room for something unprecedented. In the past, new Bitcoin highs usually lead to more awareness and more adoption from individuals, companies, and even governments. But this is never a guaranteed outcome.\nFor example, president-elect Donald Trump campaigned with a pro-Bitcoin message and it's the first time it was a major talking point from a U.S. president -- unprecedented. What happens to Bitcoin in 2025 if adoption from the federal government is put on the back burner after anticipation built up during the election cycle? Investors simply don't know because it hasn't happened before.\nIn conclusion, investors shouldn't bet on Bitcoin headed higher in 2025 simply because it follows the historical pattern. I believe there are reasons to predict it will rise, including more adoption by businesses and consumers. But as is always the case in cryptocurrency, investors should understand the dynamics at play and have a healthy dose of skepticism before buying anything.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

As a candidate, Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and said he would back a Bitcoin strategic reserve, which would order the US to purchase and hold bitcoin for an indefinite amount of time. Trump even suggested that the US might one day pay off its national debt in cryptocurrency. Many of Trump's future cabinet members and inner circle are reportedly pro-crypto, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he holds \"most\" of his net worth in bitcoin.\nFrom RTÉ Radio 1's The Business, Prof Mark Blyth from Brown University assesses what's going to happen for Bitcoin during a second Trump White House\nWith a bullish outlook, other Trump-aligned politicians are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Republican senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has proposed the Bitcoin Act of 2024, which would increase the stash of US government-owned bitcoin and potentially shore up US supremacy in a budding geopolitical competition to horde the asset. The US holds roughly 203,000 bitcoin, or about US$21 billion, which it has largely accumulated through seizures from illicit holdings.\nIt's not just Washington getting into the act. In Texas, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, a pro-bitcoin non-profit, recently tweeted that he is in \"discussions\" to help introduce a bitcoin strategic reserve in the lone star state. Pennsylvania has also passed a new bitcoin \"rights bill\" and floated creating a strategic reserve. Some think this is game theory playing out. As states rush to buy bitcoin, it could create a \"race to the top\" that forces other government entities to join the blockchain.\nAside from politicians' promises, a number of other reasons explain why many bitcoiners are poising themselves for a Trump-fuelled bull run. One is the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will keep on printing money for the foreseeable future to finance America's debt, which is currently about US$36 trillion and growing. Because the supply of bitcoin is finite – there will only ever be 21 million mined – it is often considered a hedge against runaway inflation. More available money funnelling into the scarce asset will necessarily drive up bitcoin's price.\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

While leaders of the new Department of Government Efficiency, a consulting group that Trump is planning to create, have promised to \"drain the swamp,\" sceptics question if that's possible when spending cuts on debt servicing, defence and entitlements such as social security and Medicare are all off the table. As an expanding supply of total dollars finds its way into finite assets like bitcoin, it becomes more expensive for consumers to buy.\nAnother reason for bitcoin bullishness is that the Trump administration is expected to offer more regulatory clarity over the crypto industry. This doesn't necessarily mean more deregulation, but rather outlining clearer \"rules of the road\" for how individuals and firms can trade crypto assets.\nMany bitcoiners, for example, have seen Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler, who once taught a class on blockchain technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as bad for crypto and quick to engage in arbitrary enforcement of SEC regulations. Gensler will step down down from his role on January 20th of next year, and a new Trump-appointed SEC chairman is likely to be more intent on expanding the crypto sector.\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\nFrom NBC News Meet the Press, New York Times Technology columnist Kevin Roose on why the cryptocurrency industry is optimistic about the incoming Trump administration\nA final variable pulling the price of bitcoin higher is greater institutional adoption by financial investment advisories and banks, pegged to recent SEC rulings. Earlier this year, after losing a court battle in 2023, the SEC was essentially compelled to approve \"spot\" bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are investment instruments that track bitcoin's market price.\nThese ETFs, more readily accessible to corporate as well as individual investors, have brought financial juggernauts such as Fidelity and BlackRock into the bitcoin space, signalling mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, for example, has called bitcoin \"digital gold\" and a \"legitimate\" financial commodity.\nA looming question about bitcoin is the degree to which it remains a partisan issue. While Republicans have rallied behind bitcoin as part of an economic \"freedom\" agenda, many high-ranking Democrats have been more hostile. For instance, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has been described as carrying out an \"anti-crypocurrency crusade\". However, other Democrats like New York senator Chuck Schumer have sought to reduce federal restrictions on trading crypto assets.\nRepublicans are trying to exploit their perceived advantage on the issue. Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, has insisted that the \"crypto economy is here to stay\". Meanwhile, chief executives of major crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jockeying for a seat in Trump's new proposed crypto council, which will advise the White House on policy related to crypto assets.\nIf 2024 was the \"crypto election\", the big unknown is whether Trump will really champion digital assets, or dash the hopes (and wallets) of bitcoiners everywhere.\nThomas Gift is Associate Professor and Director of the Centre on US Politics at UCL.

From Dogecoin's meteoric rise to the proliferation of memecoins, memes have proven their power to move markets and engage communities like never before. Now, with the recent addition of AI, this phenomenon is set to evolve into something even more profound.\nThe Meme Economy's Next Leap\nMemes in crypto have often been the catalyst for community engagement, driving investment through humor and cultural relevance. However, they've largely been passive, with their value fluctuating based on social trends rather than intrinsic capabilities. Enter Spectral Labs' Syntax V2, announced on November 27th, 2024, which marks a pivotal shift from static to sentient memes.\nSpectral Labs, a New York-based innovator in blockchain technology, is redefining what memes can do in the crypto space by introducing AI-powered agents. \"We’re beyond excited to unveil Syntax V2, where the power of culture can now be harnessed for real on-chain value,\" said Sishir Varghese, co-founder and CEO of Spectral Labs.\nSyntax V2: A Game Changer\nSyntax V2 stands out by allowing users to create memes that aren't just cultural icons but active participants in the crypto economy. Here's how:\nAI-Driven Autonomy: These memes can trade on platforms like Hyperliquid, using AI to analyze market data and sentiment, making them dynamic players in the market.\nCommunity Governance: Through token holder voting, these memes evolve, ensuring they reflect the collective will of their community, much like how a meme's popularity grows through shared cultural resonance.\nValue Creation: By translating cultural capital into economic activity, these sentient memes could redefine value in the crypto space, turning engagement into tangible outcomes.\nBroader Implications for Crypto\nThis innovation comes at a time when the crypto market is seeking new avenues for growth beyond traditional tokens and NFTs. Syntax V2 suggests a future where AI not only enhances trading strategies but also democratizes access to blockchain technology. It's an invitation for the average internet user to engage with crypto in a way that's both familiar and novel.\nThe Rise of @MustStopMurad's Memecoin Thesis\nParallel to the developments with Syntax V2, the crypto community has been abuzz with the memecoin thesis propagated by Murad Mahmudov, known on social media as @MustStopMurad. His well-publicized theory claims that memecoins are entering a \"supercycle,\" has gained significant traction online, resonating with the idea that cultural phenomena can drive significant market movements. Much like Syntax V2's sentient memes, Murad's thesis suggests that memecoins could see unprecedented growth due to their ability to capture community sentiment and engagement, potentially leading to a new era where memes are not just cultural but economic forces.\nLooking Forward\nAs we move towards 2025, the integration of AI into meme culture within the crypto ecosystem could lead to more sophisticated forms of digital interaction, where memes are not just shared but are active, evolving participants in the market. This could also lead to a new era of decentralized collaboration, where cultural phenomena directly influence economic outcomes.\nIn Conclusion\nThe launch of Syntax V2 by Spectral Labs is a signal of the next wave in digital asset culture. By merging AI with the vibrant world of memes, Spectral Labs is not only expanding the crypto narrative but is also setting the stage for how cultural trends might drive economic innovation in the future. For investors, creators, and enthusiasts, this could mean the dawn of a new, interactive, and potentially more democratic crypto economy, where everyone can have a stake in the cultural and financial evolution of the internet.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) shares continued to move higher along with the price of bitcoin, which traded at more than $98,000 Friday morning.\nThe business intelligence services provider is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, and is seen by many investors as one of the best stock plays tied to cryptocurrencies.\nEarlier this week, MicroStrategy announced that it had purchased an additional 55,500 bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $5.4 billion between Nov. 18 and Nov. 24, and now holds 386,700 BTC.\nIt was another strong session for MicroStrategy (MSTR), as the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin is being seen by investors as one of the best cryptocurrency stock plays.\nShares have been soaring along with the price of bitcoin since the election, with President-elect Donald Trump saying during the campaign that he wants to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" The shares, which advanced 3% in recent trading, set an all-time high last week and remain up more than 500% year-to-date.\nBitcoin traded above $98,000 Friday, boosted by comments from Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who predicted the digital coin can more than double within the next two years. Palmer said it could reach $225,000 by the end of 2026.\nEarlier this week, MicroStrategy announced that it had purchased an additional 55,500 bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $5.4 billion between Nov. 18 and Nov. 24. The company reported it paid an average of $97,862 per bitcoin. MicroStrategy explained it now holds 386,700 BTC, with an average purchase price of $56,761 each.\nTradingView","Consumers beware: With bitcoin trading solidly over $90,000 this month and closing in on the $100,000 level, cybercriminals will be circling the wagons.\n\"This is going to create a lot of FOMO and a lot of urgency around investing in bitcoin and paying with bitcoin,\" said Eva Velasquez, president and chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center. Scammers \"love, love, love to leverage external events, create confusion, create that sense of urgency and steal your hard-earned money.\"\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that legitimate strategies to make money with bitcoin are being discussed publicly by reputable sources. That, coupled with the technological advances of AI, makes scams seem more real, even for more sophisticated investors, industry professionals said.\nThe stakes are particularly high given that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 69,000 complaints last year related to cryptocurrency fraud, with estimated losses topping more than $5.6 billion. The losses associated with these complaints accounted for nearly half of the total fraud losses reported.\nWith this in mind, here's how to recognize and avoid the latest crypto scams:\nPrevalent scams today include fake bonuses in exchange for an initial investment, bogus coin promotions, phishing emails or texts that appear to come from reputable crypto companies or exchanges, Ponzi and pyramid schemes, or \"Pig butchering\" scams that involve fraudsters building trust over time, often posing as friends or romantic partners, before convincing victims to invest in fake crypto platforms.\nSchemes also commonly invoke well-known names like crypto enthusiast and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Scammers have been broadcasting fake video of Elon Musk including fake livestreams, making it seem as if he were speaking about specific cryptocurrency opportunities. In one such scam, the thieves tried to lure investors to scan a QR code before the \"livestream\" ended. Investors were promised double the amount of cryptocurrency they deposited, according to a report by Engadget.\n\"Elon Musk is not going to double your money if you send him crypto,\" said Merrick Theobald, vice president of marketing at BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment service.\nThese types of scams are likely to proliferate with Musk, who is always in the headlines, figuring even more prominently in President-elect Trump's orbit and picked to co-lead the proposed Department of Government Efficiency. The Trump administration is also expected to serve as tailwind for crypto with pro-crypto legislation expected to be one of the first legislative efforts taken up in a new Congress.\nFraudsters also use fear to ensnare victims.\nCoinbase is seeing several scams in which cyber thieves send a text claiming a crypto owner's account has been compromised. If the user responds to the text, scammers try to pry additional information such as the crypto owner's seed phrase, which allows the thieves to empty the account, said Jeff Lunglhofer, chief information security officer of Coinbase. People fall for this because it all seems plausible and the scammers convince them their assets are at risk, he added.\nIf you get a text or an email claiming there's a problem with your crypto account, don't respond or click on any links. Instead, go directly to your provider's website or call the phone number you know is attached to the provider to inquire about your account, Theobald said.\nScammers sometimes send emails or place ads on social media, offering one-time promotions for investing in crypto. These ads often look like legitimate offers from reputable companies that people may be familiar with, or have done business with in the past, said Howard Greenberg, president of The American Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association, a non-profit trade association.\nBut there might be a letter missing in the URL and if you click on it, you'll see something that looks very much like the homepage of the reputable site, confusing people more, Greenberg said. In reality, crypto owners are plugging in their credentials on a fraudulent site. \"Before you realize you've signed on to a fake site, your money is gone,\" Greenberg said. \"There's no way to do a dispute like you can with a credit card.\"\nTo avoid this problem, he recommends people bookmark the websites of the legitimate providers they use. This way, investors can go there directly to purchase crypto and they don't accidentally fall for a scam by clicking on someone else's link. In addition, he recommends people only buy crypto on reputable exchanges, which include Coinbase and Gemini. \"You don't want to be using a fly-by-night exchange out of Liechtenstein,\" Greenberg said.\nThere's the adage, \"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\" but when it comes to crypto scams, people still take the bait. Sometimes it's because they don't recognize the warning signs. These include offers that seem too good to be true, pressure tactics or unrealistic promises for returns. A little homework can save a lot of money and headaches, industry professionals said.\nYaya Fanusie, director of policy for anti-money laundering and cyber risk at the Crypto Council for Innovation, had a family member recently defrauded by a crypto scammer. The company, supposedly founded by a well-known mathematician, advertised a guaranteed investment return of 150%. Fanusie did some digging on the relative's behalf and found the supposedly famous mathematician had only a few dozen followers on LinkedIn. Fanusie was also suspicious due to the lofty investment guarantee and because his relative was being asked to communicate with the company on What'sApp, which is end-to-end encrypted and offers scammers extra protection.\nAnother red flag is if an organization asking for money claims crypto is the only payment option, Velasquez said. \"I would be very, very leery about any transaction where the only way you can pay is through cryptocurrency.\"\nFanusie recommends that prospective investors search the internet for background on any company they are considering doing business with, including where it was registered and when. He also urges would-be investors to check Fincen's website to determine whether the provider they're considering is regulated as a money service business. If a company claims to be an investment company, it's worth checking with the SEC to see if it is registered, he said.\n\"You can't take what they say on faith,\" he said.\nProspective investors should also take the time to ensure any digital coin they are considering buying is legitimate. If the token isn't listed on a mainstream site, it might not be legitimate or it might be obscure and thus riskier. One way to verify a token's legitimacy is by looking it up on price-tracking sites such as CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.\n\"Often if you do a little bit of verification … you find out that things aren't always what they seem to be,\" Fanusie said.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThis Friday morning, bitcoin is trading impressively over $97,000.
