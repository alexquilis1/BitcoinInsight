There was a 100 per cent increase in total transactions across platforms in the last three months. There was also a 200 per cent increase in sign-ups during the same period,” Menon added.\nBitcoin is currently trading at $65,000 — around six per cent lower than its all-time high reached in November 2021. The Indian crypto market is experiencing a high, riding the wave of Bitcoin rally. This surge is largely driven by growing institutional interest.\nBlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, for example, has accumulated close to a staggering $10 billion in AUM (assets under management) in just seven weeks. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs has been a game-changer, allowing traditional investors to access the crypto through familiar channels. This wider accessibility is likely contributing to the overall excitement, said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX.\nThe surge in cryptocurrency demand is driven by new exchange-traded funds purchasing it at a rate far surpassing the willingness of long-time holders to sell their Bitcoin. The largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained 50 per cent this year and most of the rise has come in the last few weeks when inflows into US-listed bitcoin funds surged. This bull run is expected to sustain as Bitcoin goes through a halving cycle in April, which could potentially increase the demand as well as the price for Bitcoin even further.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The price of Bitcoin soared to $69,191.94, surpassing its previous record of $68,991 set in November 2021.\nThis surge was propelled by investors channeling funds into U.S. spot exchange-traded cryptocurrency products and the anticipation of potential declines in global interest rates.\nFollowing the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission in late January, investor interest has surged. However, the market subsequently experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin trading lower. Presently, Bitcoin is priced at $68,440.\nAlso read: Bitcoin surge: Why should you still not invest in cryptos? These are 7 key reasons\nBitcoin's staggering surge of almost 160% since October, with a remarkable 44% spike occurring solely in February, presents a stark juxtaposition to the crypto winter of 2022. During that period, the market endured an 18-month-long downturn characterized by notable corporate bankruptcies and scandals.\nThe resurgence of Bitcoin, along with the broader crypto market, can be attributed not only to increased demand from a more diverse investor base but also to the anticipation of the Federal Reserve's potential decision to reduce U.S. interest rates. Such moves often lead investors to redirect capital towards assets offering higher yields or exhibiting greater volatility.\n“The market is witnessing a notable resurgence, with Bitcoin's price reaching towards its record highs, accompanied by a significant influx of institutional investment, which are the primary catalysts for this upward trend. While meme coins are experiencing a transient upswing fueled by FOMO, the true drivers of this rally remain established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are attracting robust demand from major investors,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder, CoinDCX.\nGupta further added, “The introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is fundamentally altering the market landscape by providing a more accessible and secure avenue for individuals of diverse financial backgrounds to participate in the crypto ecosystem. These investment vehicles are unlocking significant latent demand for crypto, as evidenced by the rapid growth of BlackRock's bitcoin ETF. This particular fund has reached $10 billion in assets under management within such a short timeframe, with projections suggesting that the next $10 billion could be accumulated even faster. These developments strongly suggest that institutional adoption is playing a pivotal role in propelling the current crypto rally.”\nAlso read: Crypto trading reaches 10-month high in India: Report\nThis year, investors have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrencies, mega-cap technology stocks, and investment-grade corporate bonds, especially. Analysts suggest that bitcoin, in particular, has seen significant traction leading up to April's anticipated halving event. This event, occurring every four years, involves a reduction in the rate at which tokens are released, along with the rewards granted to miners.\nThe total supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, with approximately 19 million already mined, according to reports. Despite its recent surge in popularity, many investors remain wary of bitcoin due to its high volatility and perceived lack of substantial real-world applications beyond speculative investment.\nHowever, amidst a mix of factors such as increased inflows into Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the anticipation of limited bitcoin supply, and potential future declines in U.S. interest rates, some companies are diversifying their corporate holdings by adding cryptocurrencies to their portfolios.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

Regulatory uncertainties in over 190 countries, exemplified by Nigeria's recent crackdown on cryptocurrency transactions, pose significant challenges for investors,” says Gaurav Mehta, Co-founder and CEO, Catax- Simple Crypto Taxes.\n“While developments like the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in the US may grab headlines, the practical realities of navigating regulatory landscapes vary widely from country to country. Indian investors, therefore, are urged to prioritise local regulations and the government stance has been indirect but clear,” he adds.\n1. Lack of regulations: In India, cryptocurrencies are yet not regulated. As capital markets regulator Sebi regulates investments in stocks and derivatives, banking transactions are regulated by the RBI; crypto transactions do not have any regulator as yet.\n2. Volatility: Price rise is a function of volatility. When bitcoin can spike because of it, it can – conversely – pare gains at the same time at the same pace. Bitcoin has moved from $68,000 to $28,000 to return to $68,000 between Nov 2021 to March 2024. In 2023 alone, bitcoin jumped by a whopping 160 percent.\nDeribit DVOL index, a measure of expected price volatility of bitcoins over the next 30 days, has surged to 76%, highest since Nov 2022, CoinDesk reported.\n3. Critical views: Time and again, India’s banking regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been overly critical of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins.\nIn a press release, RBI had even stated that any user, investors, trader, etc dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.\n4. Intrinsic value: One argument that often goes against cryptocurrencies is that they have no intrinsic or tangible value.\nALSO READ: Crypto trading reaches 10-month high in India: Report\n“Think of any store of value – they are either currencies, or financial assets or commodities which are tangible and have intrinsic value (works of art like paintings also have historical, aesthetic and scarcity value). We have seen that cryptocurrencies are none of these. Notwithstanding their current valuations, if a threshold number of people decide to opt out, the entire values can easily collapse to nothing,” the statement by T Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India on Feb 14, 2022, reads.\nP Vasudevan, executive director at RBI also echoes similar sentiments. “Cryptocurrencies cannot be called currencies as they don't have any underlying value,” he said during a panel discussion last month.\n5. Greater fool theory: Warren Buffett, known as a legend of investing, too, have strong views on bitcoins. The Oracle of Omaha once remarked that if all the bitcoins in the world are made available for $25, he will still not buy them.\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates once called NFTs and cryptos to be 100 percent based on the greater fool theory.\n6. Frauds galore in past: Remember Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange in the US? The exchange went bankrupt, and Bankman — poster boy of cryptocurrrencies in America — was convicted of seven counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Sam was ironically included in the 2021 list of Forbes 30 under 30.\nA similar fraud was reported from Canada where one of the largest crypto exchanges Quardriga went bankrupt and crypto assets worth $119 million of 1,15,000 customers went missing.\n7. High taxes minus legitimacy: In 2022, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharmaan introduced 30 percent capital gains tax and 1 percent TDS on crypto transactions but this did not construe as a green signal to crypto transactions.\nMs Sitharaman has often stated that any set of regulations in virtual digital currencies would require global consensus.\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make a last-ditch argument, according to those reports.\nApple shares were down 3% on Monday.\nRead more here.\nGasoline prices have seen sharp increases amid recent refinery constraints and higher oil prices.\nThe national average at the pump sat at $3.35 per gallon on Monday, up $0.09 from a week ago, but still $0.05 lower from exactly one year ago, according to AAA data.\n\"US refining has been stunted by severe weather and some power losses at key plants. We may in the next few days see US retail gas prices at a higher number than year-ago,\" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS, told Yahoo Finance.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures were trading just below the $79 level on Monday while Brent (BZ=F) fell to trade below $83 per barrel.\nCrude dipped despite an agreement by oil alliance OPEC+ to extend output cuts of 2.2 million per day into the second quarter.

It has rallied more than 20% since then to hover above $66,500 on Monday afternoon.\nBitcoin's all-time record high of $68,789.63 was reached in November 2021.\nOther corners of the crypto market have also rallied. Ethereum (ETH-USD) was up more than 2% on Monday to trade above $3,500.\nFord (F) stock rose more than 3% on Monday after a rise in the automaker's February sales, making the Dearborn-based automaker the No. 1 seller in America for the second straight month.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports, Ford also noted hybrid and EV sales gains, highlighting the importance of its electrified powertrains.\nFord reported February sales were up 10.5% to 174,192 vehicles, topping Toyota’s total of 159,262.\nInterestingly, hybrid sales jumped 31.5%, to slightly over 12,000 units, powered by record sales of the Maverick hybrid compact pickup and the Ford Escape small SUV hybrid.\nRead more here.\nTesla (TSLA)\nShares of Tesla slid roughly 6% on Monday following a decline in the EV maker's February vehicle shipments out of its Shanghai factory along with recent reports of an escalating price war in China. Tesla shares are down 23% year to date.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\nSuper Micro Computer stock popped as much as 26% on Monday ahead of the AI server maker's entry on the S&P 500. Shares of San Jose, Calif.-based IT company have surged more than 290% since the start of the year amid an ongoing AI craze.\nBitcoin (BTC-US)\nThe token topped $67,000 on Monday as it inched closer to all-time highs. Bitcoin has rallied more than 20% in just one week.\nThe cryptocurrency is less than a few percentage points away from reaching its November 2021 all-time high of $68,789.63.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $66,000 on Monday as the cryptocurrency inches closer towards a record high.

Maybe, just maybe, the economy is stronger than expected and by extension, profits for companies will be stronger than expected for all of this year.\nGood chart below from Draho.\nAnother Wall Street strategy team is out with an optimistic projection on how far stocks will run this year.\nIn a note to clients on Sunday, Bank of America's US equity and quantitive strategy team led by Savita Subramanian boosted its year-end target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to 5,400 from 5,000. This projection along with a recent call from UBS are the most bullish predictions for the benchmark average this year among strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance.\n\"Bull markets end with euphoria — we're not there yet,\" Subramanian wrote. \"Sentiment has improved, but areas of euphoria are limited (AI, GLP-1).\"\nBofA's move is the fifth boosted price target from strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance in the last month. The more optimistic outlooks come as stocks have ripped higher to start the year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite just closed out their best February since 2015, supported by a second straight quarter of earnings growth and an increased confidence in the trajectory of the US economy.\nSubramanian noted that fourth quarter earnings grew 4% compared to the year prior and analysts aren't cutting their forecasts for the current quarter at their normal rate. This comes as Bank of America's economics research team just boosted their outlook for growth this year too. That combination of an increased earnings outlook and a more bullish outlook for the US economy has been a common thread in the recent S&P 500 year-end target boosts across Wall Street.\nMacy’s (M) stock jumped as much as 16% on Monday after activist shareholder Arkhouse Management upped its buyout bid to $6.6 billion for the iconic retailer. Macy's had rejected a prior $5.8 billion offer from the private equity firm and its partner, Brigade Capital, in late January.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, Macy’s (M) is looking to turn over a new leaf, but a battle to take it private is growing and doubts linger on whether the company can engineer a comeback with its current plans.\nTony Spring, freshly minted as CEO a month ago, acknowledges that the business needs to change.\n\"We are not going to leave Macy's as it is today. It's foolhardy to think that leaving the business as it exists today is a recipe for success in the future,\" Spring told Yahoo Finance.\nSpring said the brand will \"evolve,\" adjust its product offering, and integrate its physical and digital presence \"thoughtfully,\" but will do so \"with the appropriate action, ... time, and support of our organization.”\nArkhouse Management's new bid released on Sunday shows the activist investor isn't waiting for the results.\nRead more here.\nStocks opened lower on Monday, pausing their recent rally as the market prepares for testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week and a monthly jobs report that could put equity gains to the test.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed about 0.2% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composit (^IXIC) was little changed.\nAlso on Monday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose to top $65,000, inching closer to a record high.\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) stock plunged as much as 16% in pre-market trading on Monday after its $3.8 billion merger agreement with JetBlue (JBLU), blocked by a court in January, was terminated by the low-cost carriers.\n\"After discussing our options with our advisors and JetBlue, we concluded that current regulatory obstacles will not permit us to close this transaction in a timely fashion under the merger agreement,\" Spirit's CEO Ted Christie said in a company statement.\nJetBlue’s proposed acquisition of Spirit fell apart after a federal judge blocked the deal on Jan. 16 amid antitrust concerns.\nShares of JetBlue gained more than 5% in pre-market trading after the announcement. Spirit shares are down roughly 60% year to date.\nSome of the hottest trending tickers on Yahoo Finance this morning are crypto-related. No surprise as bitcoin has busted through $65,000 and excitement builds for a potential halving event in April.\nBut to me, the main story in markets remains the frenzied trade around AI sweetheart Nvidia (NVDA). As this stock goes, so too will go the market in 2024 (and 2025, 2026, 2027…).\nA few stats on Nvidia to get you thinking:","The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of about $68,800 Tuesday, surpassing the previous record reached in November 2021.\nThe cryptocurrency has gained approximately 50% in 2024, and has recovered more than 300% since hitting a post-pandemic low of about $16,500 in December 2022.\nThe latest rally is being fueled by hopes that the launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, will expand the pool of bitcoin buyers.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs in January to make it easier for investors to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios without having to go through the sometimes-onerous process of owning the digital coins themselves.\nThe ETFs have collectively already attracted billions of dollars of investments.\nThe cryptocurrency world is also banking on a price rally coming after a technical event known as \"halving\" occurs in April. That causes the rate of supply of new bitcoin to decline. So if demand remains unchanged or even grows, the price goes up.\nBitcoin remains highly controversial, and many mainstream investment experts and market regulators urge caution about investing in it. For instance, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency's ETF approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, calling it a “speculative, volatile asset.”\nAnd in a blog post in January, executives at the financial giant Vanguard echoed that view, saying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \"more of a speculation than an investment,\" which is why the company does not offer crypto products.\n\"With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends,\" Vanguard said. \"With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a role in certain portfolios.\"\n\"While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.\"\nRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.","Bitcoin’s hot streak continued Monday when it surged to almost $67,000 — its highest value in more than two years. The cryptocurrency set a record in November 2021, at just one cent below $69,000. Bitcoin has gained more than 40% in market value this year as it closes in on the $69,000 record.\nThat rise is partly due to the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January, which allows investors to trade the cryptocurrency with less risk. The approval drew lots of new investors into the cryptocurrency market.\nSince trading started for spot bitcoin ETFs, more than $6 billion has entered the market, with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust surging 62% since January. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase and cryptocurrency miner Marathon Digital Holdings have outperformed bitcoin this year, gaining 59% and 45%, respectively.\nInvestors are anticipating Bitcoin’s “halving” event next month, which is expected to keep the cryptocurrency surging over the next few months. The event, which happens every four years, is when bitcoin miners start to gain only half the reward for minting new bitcoin. That reward will be cut from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125. The technical event was written into bitcoin’s code to safeguard the cryptocurrency from inflation and will continue until it reaches the cap of 21 million, which was created to make bitcoin a finite resource. After every 210,000 blocks are added to the chain, the reward is cut in half to slow down the pace of adding bitcoin to the supply in circulation.\nThree previous halving events have seen the price of bitcoin rise in the months following. The latest event in May 2020 saw bitcoin’s price, which was around $8,750, increase 79% six months later, and 547% a year later.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."]}

Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down more than 1%.\nApple came under pressure after a report that iPhone sales fell 24% in China, adding to Monday's loss in the wake of a $2 billion EU antitrust fine.

However, the cryptocurrency experienced a sizable drop shortly after, plummeting 10% to trade just around $62,000 a coin.\nThe debate now is whether the tech gains behind the recent record-setting stock rally have reached their peak, as downbeat news saps the \"FOMO\" — fear of missing out — seen as keeping investors engaged.\nAt the same time, faith in coming easing by the Federal Reserve took a knock after comments by policymaker Raphael Bostic. The Atlanta Fed president said he sees just one rate cut this year, penciled in for the third quarter.\nInvestors are now even more focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on Wednesday. His words will be closely watched for any change in the mantra that policymakers need to be convinced inflation is conquered before any move.\nIn corporates, Target (TGT) earnings beat Wall Street forecasts, helping shares pop more than 10%.\nShares of CrowdStrike jumped 17% after the cybersecurity firm reported quarterly earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.\nCrowdStrike projected first quarter adjusted earnings between $0.89 and $0.90 a share, ahead of the $0.82 estimate analysts had expected. The company's sales forecast of $902.2 to $905.8 million also topped estimates of $898.8 million.\n\"CrowdStrike delivered an exceptionally strong and record fourth quarter with net new annually recurring revenue (ARR) growth accelerating to 27% year-over-year, reaching a new high of $282 million and ending ARR growing 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion,\" George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, chief executive officer, and co-founder said in the earnings release.\nShares have surged nearly 40% since the start of the year.\nUS stocks closed lower on Tuesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\nContracts on the Nasdaq sank about 1.7% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down more than 1%.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), which briefly touched a fresh all-time high, tumbled about 10% to trade around $62,000 a coin.\nThe stock market bubble debate has gripped markets over the past week as an AI-driven surge in stocks has sent the major indexes to record levels.\nBut the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs told Yahoo Finance the underlying dynamics of the current rally don't indicate the market has reached levels of euphoria on par with past bubbles.\nUsing an enterprise value-to-sales ratio, Goldman Sachs analyzed the percentage of US stocks that have what the firm considers to be high valuations. The results showed highly valued stocks currently account for 24% of the US equity market, lower than 28% seen in 2021 and the 35% during the late 90s tech bubble.\nNotably, there are also far fewer overvalued companies contributing to this recent run.\n\"If we look at the number of companies that are trading at very elevated multiples, that looks even less extreme relative to history,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance. \"So effectively, as we all know, there are a small number today of very large companies trading at elevated multiples, rather than what we saw in 2021, just a couple years ago, where there seemed to be widespread euphoria priced across the market.\"\nHowever, the narrowly driven rally with a few highly valued companies driving the market (seen in the light blue line above) is reminiscent of the tech bubble in the early 2000s Snider believes the crucial difference this time around is that moves higher in many of the large-cap tech stocks have been in line with earnings growth. Snider says that was not the case with market darlings like Nortel Networks in the dot-com bubble.\n\"Our view is that this is not a bubble and the simplest explanation is that prices and the valuations of these megacap stocks, whether you're calling them the Mag Seven or others, have really been driven by a combination of superior growth and strong balance sheets, and both of those qualities historically have warranted premium valuations,\" Snider said.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled 11% on Tuesday, despite briefly touching a fresh all-time high.\nEarlier in the session, the cryptocurrency breached $68,991 to surpass its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. But the euphoria was short-lived.\nBitcoin, currently trading at just above $60,000 a coin, is now having its worst day since Nov. 9, 2022 — just before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\nDisney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger said Tuesday that he is trying his best to not let an ongoing proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz divert his focus on turning around the business.\n\"I am working really hard to not let this distract me because when I get distracted, everybody who works for me is distracted and that's not a good thing,\" Iger said at Morgan Stanley's media and telecom conference on Tuesday.\nLast year, Peltz and his hedge fund Trian Fund Management renewed a push to shake up the company's board as the stock price hit multiyear lows. Disney has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in streaming.\nIger pointed to the complexities of running Disney's multifaceted business as various segments like streaming face increased disruption.\n\"It's [a business] that takes not only a significant amount of knowledge, but a tremendous amount of time and focus,\" he said. \"This campaign is in a way designed to distract us. ... Time and focus is necessary to generate what we need to generate for the shareholders.\"\nIger's comments come after Trian published a 130-page white paper on Monday blaming the board for Disney's underperformance and accusing its members of lacking \"focus, alignment and accountability.\"\nPeltz is currently seeking board seats for himself, along with former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo. If the proxy battle continues to a vote, a shareholder meeting set to take place on April 3 will ultimately determine the board's fate.\nAnother investment firm, Blackwells Capital, supports the company's current board but has urged shareholders to vote for its three nominees as additions to it.\nDisney's stock has fought its way back from record lows with shares up about 11% year over year.\nSince the start of 2024, shares have climbed about 25%, outpacing the S&P 500's 6% rise over that same time period.\nIt's a down day for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are all in the red on Tuesday.\nBut as we highlighted about a month ago, history tells us stocks can still go up this year even if the \"Magnificent Seven\" lose steam.\nResearch from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski on Feb. 6 showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historically have been quite good.\nA chart from Belski shows that since 1992, on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\n\"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,\" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI): The stock plummeted around 13% after the company announced a new debt offering. SoFi said it plans to offer $750 million of convertible senior notes due in 2029. Part of the proceeds will pay for the cost of entering into capped call transactions, which are intended \"to reduce the potential dilution to SoFi’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and\/or offset any potential cash payments.\"\nTarget Corporation (TGT): Shares jumped about 13% after the retail giant posted an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines. The company has preached its \"roadmap for growth,\" which includes establishing Target as a growth company \"from a comparable sales standpoint, from a traffic standpoint, and from a [market] share standpoint.\"\nMeta Platforms (META): Shares dipped just over 1% after the company experienced a wave of outages to its suite of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.\nCrowdStrike (CRWD): Shares dropped roughly 7% ahead of the company's quarterly earnings, due after the bell on Tuesday. Prior to the results, CrowdStrike announced an expansion of its partnership with Dell Technologies, which will help customers \"defend against increasingly complex cyberattacks.\"\nMarket losses escalated by early afternoon trading with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) leading the broader declines. The tech-heavy index sank about 1.8% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely.\nApple shares fell roughly 3% on a report that iPhone sales fell 24% in China. Tesla's stock declined 4.5% as a shutdown at its Berlin Gigafactory added to concerns over a shipment slump and a Chinese price war.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved roughly 0.8%.\nBullion rose to new highs on Tuesday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates along with continuing geopolitical tension.\nGold futures (GC=F) reached a high of $2,150.50 earlier on Tuesday after April contracts settled at a record $2,126.30 per ounce in the prior session. On Tuesday spot gold touched a record of $2,141.79 before retreating.\nThe precious metal is considered a safe haven during times of uncertainty, usually moving up when the US dollar moves lower and interest rates decrease.\nInvestors are expecting the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates later this year.\nGold has held up above the $2,000 level over the past couple of months despite a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. Central banks have been buying up gold for their reserves at historic levels, helping drive up demand.\nAdjusted for inflation, gold hit a record in 1980 when it hit $850 per ounce, which would equal almost $3,200 in today's dollars.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) reached a fresh all-time high of $68,991 to briefly surpass its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. It's since retreated to trade around $67,000 a coin.\nThe run-up in prices comes amid US regulators' approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January. According to Bloomberg, the ETFs generated more than $4.2 billion in net new flows in just one month.\nPrices of other cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) have also seen a boon amid the bitcoin surge. Ether prices have increased 66% since the start of the year to trade around $3,800 a coin.\nIt's a day likely to be full of Super Tuesday analysis from various market pundits and other experts.\nSo why not join in the fun here at Yahoo Finance?\nA good note from one of my favorite economists, Michael Schumacher over at Wells Fargo, just crossed my inbox. I found it helpful to see how he is thinking through potential market moves months before the election, with a specific focus on fiscal and monetary policy.\nSchumacher's thoughts:\nRepublican sweep\n\"In our opinion, a Republican sweep is the scenario that would cause the biggest increase in the deficit and Treasury’s financing need after 2025. We expect easier fiscal policy under a Trump administration, especially if Republicans gain control of Congress. President Trump quite likely would want to extend, if not expand, his previous tax cuts. We expect this scenario to have the largest impact on Treasury term premium and the yield curve (e.g. 5s\/30s). As we noted previously, the curve probably will steepen if Trump wins big over the next few weeks and a Republican sweep becomes increasingly likely.\"\nDemocratic sweep\n\"This scenario also seems quite likely to involve a larger deficit and steeper Treasury curve, but by a smaller margin than in a Republican sweep. Our economists say “Even if Democrats sweep on Election Day, we doubt they would allow the TCJA to completely expire as scheduled”. Tax rates could conceivably rise even more for top income earners. Furthermore, corporate income tax increases are also more likely in this scenario. Although some of the individual income tax provisions are likely to expire as planned we expect more meaningful spending packages to accompany the expiration of the tax cuts.\"\nUS stocks slipped on Tuesday, once again retreating from record highs.\nAt the opening bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved about 0.3% lower after a losing start to the week. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank roughly 0.8% amid continued drags from Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA).\nSuper Tuesday is unlikely to move markets.\nTotally get it, besides there is a lot more happening this week in markets from wild moves in bitcoin to the slide in Tesla's (TSLA) stock.\nBut at some point this year, what's shaping up to be a contentious US presidential election will move markets. That's why I am banking comments on the election from top leaders today in order to help guide investors through the murky waters months from now.\nTarget (TGT) chairman and CEO Brian Cornell — who I last physically saw inside the White House a few months ago before a meeting with the Biden administration —didn't give me a lot on his macro views on Super Tuesday. He did give me just enough in a phone chat, however, to begin thinking how the consumer stock trade may act in the months before November.\nHere's what he told me:\n\"We're watching [the election] like you are, really carefully.

Any cuts would relieve pressure on the economy and financial system.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will give testimony before Congress later this week, which could further sway expectations for when cuts to rates could begin.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.13% from 4.22% late Monday.\nIn stock markets abroad, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 2.6% after China’s premier said the country’s target for economic growth this year is around 5%, in line with expectations. .\nLi Qiang, addressing the opening meeting of China’s National People’s Congress, also said Beijing would issue 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) in long-term bonds to help bridge funding gaps, provide support to financially strapped local governments and invest in both advanced technology and in social support and education.\nBut the government’s intention to keep its deficit at 3% the size of China’s overall economy may have disappointed investors hoping for more aggressive action.\nStocks in Shanghai inched up by 0.3%, while indexes were modestly lower across much of the rest of the world.\n___\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.\nStan Choe, The Associated Press","Oops, something went wrong\nUS stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, pulling further away from record highs as uncertainty over interest rate cuts and a shakeup in \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks brought a note of wariness to the market.\nContracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day's declines, sinking about 1.7% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down more than 1%.\nApple came under pressure after a report that iPhone sales fell 24% in China, adding to Monday's loss in the wake of a $2 billion EU antitrust fine. Tesla continued to slump as a shutdown at its Berlin Gigafactory added to concerns over a shipment slump and a Chinese price war.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) reached a fresh all-time high, briefly surpassing its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. However, the cryptocurrency experienced a sizable drop shortly after, plummeting 10% to trade just around $62,000 a coin.\nThe debate now is whether the tech gains behind the recent record-setting stock rally have reached their peak, as downbeat news saps the \"FOMO\" — fear of missing out — seen as keeping investors engaged.\nAt the same time, faith in coming easing by the Federal Reserve took a knock after comments by policymaker Raphael Bostic. The Atlanta Fed president said he sees just one rate cut this year, penciled in for the third quarter.\nInvestors are now even more focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on Wednesday. His words will be closely watched for any change in the mantra that policymakers need to be convinced inflation is conquered before any move.\nIn corporates, Target (TGT) earnings beat Wall Street forecasts, helping shares pop more than 10%.\nShares of CrowdStrike jumped 17% after the cybersecurity firm reported quarterly earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.\nCrowdStrike projected first quarter adjusted earnings between $0.89 and $0.90 a share, ahead of the $0.82 estimate analysts had expected. The company's sales forecast of $902.2 to $905.8 million also topped estimates of $898.8 million.\n\"CrowdStrike delivered an exceptionally strong and record fourth quarter with net new annually recurring revenue (ARR) growth accelerating to 27% year-over-year, reaching a new high of $282 million and ending ARR growing 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion,\" George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, chief executive officer, and co-founder said in the earnings release.\nShares have surged nearly 40% since the start of the year.\nUS stocks closed lower on Tuesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\nContracts on the Nasdaq sank about 1.7% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down more than 1%.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), which briefly touched a fresh all-time high, tumbled about 10% to trade around $62,000 a coin.\nThe stock market bubble debate has gripped markets over the past week as an AI-driven surge in stocks has sent the major indexes to record levels.\nBut the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs told Yahoo Finance the underlying dynamics of the current rally don't indicate the market has reached levels of euphoria on par with past bubbles.\nUsing an enterprise value-to-sales ratio, Goldman Sachs analyzed the percentage of US stocks that have what the firm considers to be high valuations. The results showed highly valued stocks currently account for 24% of the US equity market, lower than 28% seen in 2021 and the 35% during the late 90s tech bubble.\nNotably, there are also far fewer overvalued companies contributing to this recent run.\n\"If we look at the number of companies that are trading at very elevated multiples, that looks even less extreme relative to history,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance. \"So effectively, as we all know, there are a small number today of very large companies trading at elevated multiples, rather than what we saw in 2021, just a couple years ago, where there seemed to be widespread euphoria priced across the market.\"\nHowever, the narrowly driven rally with a few highly valued companies driving the market (seen in the light blue line above) is reminiscent of the tech bubble in the early 2000s Snider believes the crucial difference this time around is that moves higher in many of the large-cap tech stocks have been in line with earnings growth. Snider says that was not the case with market darlings like Nortel Networks in the dot-com bubble.\n\"Our view is that this is not a bubble and the simplest explanation is that prices and the valuations of these megacap stocks, whether you're calling them the Mag Seven or others, have really been driven by a combination of superior growth and strong balance sheets, and both of those qualities historically have warranted premium valuations,\" Snider said.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled 11% on Tuesday, despite briefly touching a fresh all-time high.\nEarlier in the session, the cryptocurrency breached $68,991 to surpass its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. But the euphoria was short-lived.\nBitcoin, currently trading at just above $60,000 a coin, is now having its worst day since Nov. 9, 2022 — just before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\nDisney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger said Tuesday that he is trying his best to not let an ongoing proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz divert his focus on turning around the business.\n\"I am working really hard to not let this distract me because when I get distracted, everybody who works for me is distracted and that's not a good thing,\" Iger said at Morgan Stanley's media and telecom conference on Tuesday.\nLast year, Peltz and his hedge fund Trian Fund Management renewed a push to shake up the company's board as the stock price hit multiyear lows. Disney has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in streaming.\nIger pointed to the complexities of running Disney's multifaceted business as various segments like streaming face increased disruption.\n\"It's [a business] that takes not only a significant amount of knowledge, but a tremendous amount of time and focus,\" he said. \"This campaign is in a way designed to distract us. ... Time and focus is necessary to generate what we need to generate for the shareholders.\"\nIger's comments come after Trian published a 130-page white paper on Monday blaming the board for Disney's underperformance and accusing its members of lacking \"focus, alignment and accountability.\"\nPeltz is currently seeking board seats for himself, along with former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo. If the proxy battle continues to a vote, a shareholder meeting set to take place on April 3 will ultimately determine the board's fate.\nAnother investment firm, Blackwells Capital, supports the company's current board but has urged shareholders to vote for its three nominees as additions to it.\nDisney's stock has fought its way back from record lows with shares up about 11% year over year.\nSince the start of 2024, shares have climbed about 25%, outpacing the S&P 500's 6% rise over that same time period.\nIt's a down day for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are all in the red on Tuesday.\nBut as we highlighted about a month ago, history tells us stocks can still go up this year even if the \"Magnificent Seven\" lose steam.\nResearch from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski on Feb. 6 showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historically have been quite good.\nA chart from Belski shows that since 1992, on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\n\"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,\" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI): The stock plummeted around 13% after the company announced a new debt offering. SoFi said it plans to offer $750 million of convertible senior notes due in 2029. Part of the proceeds will pay for the cost of entering into capped call transactions, which are intended \"to reduce the potential dilution to SoFi’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and\/or offset any potential cash payments.\"\nTarget Corporation (TGT): Shares jumped about 13% after the retail giant posted an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines. The company has preached its \"roadmap for growth,\" which includes establishing Target as a growth company \"from a comparable sales standpoint, from a traffic standpoint, and from a [market] share standpoint.\"\nMeta Platforms (META): Shares dipped just over 1% after the company experienced a wave of outages to its suite of social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.\nCrowdStrike (CRWD): Shares dropped roughly 7% ahead of the company's quarterly earnings, due after the bell on Tuesday. Prior to the results, CrowdStrike announced an expansion of its partnership with Dell Technologies, which will help customers \"defend against increasingly complex cyberattacks.\"\nMarket losses escalated by early afternoon trading with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) leading the broader declines. The tech-heavy index sank about 1.8% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely.\nApple shares fell roughly 3% on a report that iPhone sales fell 24% in China. Tesla's stock declined 4.5% as a shutdown at its Berlin Gigafactory added to concerns over a shipment slump and a Chinese price war.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved roughly 0.8%.\nBullion rose to new highs on Tuesday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates along with continuing geopolitical tension.\nGold futures (GC=F) reached a high of $2,150.50 earlier on Tuesday after April contracts settled at a record $2,126.30 per ounce in the prior session. On Tuesday spot gold touched a record of $2,141.79 before retreating.\nThe precious metal is considered a safe haven during times of uncertainty, usually moving up when the US dollar moves lower and interest rates decrease.\nInvestors are expecting the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates later this year.\nGold has held up above the $2,000 level over the past couple of months despite a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. Central banks have been buying up gold for their reserves at historic levels, helping drive up demand.\nAdjusted for inflation, gold hit a record in 1980 when it hit $850 per ounce, which would equal almost $3,200 in today's dollars.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) reached a fresh all-time high of $68,991 to briefly surpass its previous record of $68,789 from November 2021. It's since retreated to trade around $67,000 a coin.\nThe run-up in prices comes amid US regulators' approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January. According to Bloomberg, the ETFs generated more than $4.2 billion in net new flows in just one month.\nPrices of other cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) have also seen a boon amid the bitcoin surge. Ether prices have increased 66% since the start of the year to trade around $3,800 a coin.\nIt's a day likely to be full of Super Tuesday analysis from various market pundits and other experts.\nSo why not join in the fun here at Yahoo Finance?\nA good note from one of my favorite economists, Michael Schumacher over at Wells Fargo, just crossed my inbox. I found it helpful to see how he is thinking through potential market moves months before the election, with a specific focus on fiscal and monetary policy.\nSchumacher's thoughts:\nRepublican sweep\n\"In our opinion, a Republican sweep is the scenario that would cause the biggest increase in the deficit and Treasury’s financing need after 2025. We expect easier fiscal policy under a Trump administration, especially if Republicans gain control of Congress. President Trump quite likely would want to extend, if not expand, his previous tax cuts. We expect this scenario to have the largest impact on Treasury term premium and the yield curve (e.g. 5s\/30s). As we noted previously, the curve probably will steepen if Trump wins big over the next few weeks and a Republican sweep becomes increasingly likely.\"\nDemocratic sweep\n\"This scenario also seems quite likely to involve a larger deficit and steeper Treasury curve, but by a smaller margin than in a Republican sweep. Our economists say “Even if Democrats sweep on Election Day, we doubt they would allow the TCJA to completely expire as scheduled”. Tax rates could conceivably rise even more for top income earners. Furthermore, corporate income tax increases are also more likely in this scenario. Although some of the individual income tax provisions are likely to expire as planned we expect more meaningful spending packages to accompany the expiration of the tax cuts.\"\nUS stocks slipped on Tuesday, once again retreating from record highs.\nAt the opening bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved about 0.3% lower after a losing start to the week. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank roughly 0.8% amid continued drags from Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA).\nSuper Tuesday is unlikely to move markets.\nTotally get it, besides there is a lot more happening this week in markets from wild moves in bitcoin to the slide in Tesla's (TSLA) stock.\nBut at some point this year, what's shaping up to be a contentious US presidential election will move markets. That's why I am banking comments on the election from top leaders today in order to help guide investors through the murky waters months from now.\nTarget (TGT) chairman and CEO Brian Cornell — who I last physically saw inside the White House a few months ago before a meeting with the Biden administration —didn't give me a lot on his macro views on Super Tuesday. He did give me just enough in a phone chat, however, to begin thinking how the consumer stock trade may act in the months before November.\nHere's what he told me:\n\"We're watching [the election] like you are, really carefully. We've looked at past trends during election years. I think that it makes sure we bring that little bit of joy to the guests during uncertain times. Make sure we make Target a special place for them to shop, filled with relevant product and great value. But we know they're still going to consume, and we want to be a destination during what could be a very challenging and uncertain period of time.\"","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nUS stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, pulling further away from record highs as uncertainty over interest rate cuts and a shakeup in \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks brought a note of wariness to the market.\nContracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day's declines, sinking about 1.7% as a retreat in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) continued to drag on stocks more widely.

Some information may no longer be current.\nBitcoin is all the rage in global finance once again, as another wave of infatuation with the controversial asset class washes over the investing masses.\nThe long winter that followed the collapse of the crypto sector starting in 2021 appears to be over. The price of bitcoin returned to record territory this week, spurred on by the introduction of a suite of new U.S. funds that brings bitcoin further into the fold of mainstream investing.\nThese exchange-traded funds give access to bitcoin ownership through listings that trade on major U.S. stock exchanges, rather than cryptocurrency platforms. While spot bitcoin ETFs have already been trading in Canada for three years, their U.S. debut opens up the bitcoin market to the immensity of the U.S. retail-investor base.\nIn just two months of trading, more than US$8-billion has poured into the 10 U.S. spot bitcoin funds. This past Tuesday alone, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust took in an incredible US$788-million, and its total assets have already eclipsed US$10-billion – the fastest of any new ETF to hit that mark.\nThis swell of retail adoption again brings the question of suitability to the fore. Now that everyday investors can easily access bitcoin, should they?\nGreg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments, argues that bitcoin can serve a role as a diversifying asset in traditional portfolios.\n“This is probably something that investors can no longer ignore,” he said, noting that rather than fading into obscurity, bitcoin has proved its staying power.\nSince bottoming out in November, 2022, the price of bitcoin has shot up by more than 300 per cent. Its record high in excess of US$69,000 set on Tuesday caps a monumental comeback from the depths of the bitcoin selloff.\nWith rising institutional acceptance of bitcoin, crypto bulls are now imagining near-limitless potential, as they scramble to raise their target prices. Six figures now seems to be table stakes, while the upper end of bitcoin projections have hit US$1-million.\nInvestors have seen this movie before, of course. Bitcoin is being hailed as the future, much as it was in 2021, when it last became a cultural phenomenon.\nIf you’re a little behind, that ended quite poorly. Crypto prices crashed, culminating in the collapse of FTX, a crypto exchange once valued at US$32-billion. Investors big and small got burned. More than three-quarters of those who bought bitcoin between 2015 and 2022 lost money, according to estimates by the Bank for International Settlements.\nBitcoin’s previous act doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in its revival. What’s different now?\nFor starters, bitcoin wasn’t the only asset to face a painful reckoning in 2021. Financial markets were awash in speculative excess, inflating bubbles in all manner of assets from stocks to fine art.\nThere have also been some key improvements to regulation and oversight as a result of the FTX debacle, Mr. Taylor said.\nFurthermore, the ETF structure will likely comfort many investors who have no inclination to set up a digital wallet.\nETFs are acclaimed for democratizing investing, and giving everyday investors access to asset classes and strategies that were once the purview of the pros.\nAnything that’s listed on a major U.S. exchange also enjoys the full weight of the U.S. legal and regulatory infrastructure. That could help legitimize bitcoin in the eyes of the skeptic.\n“But it says nothing whatsoever on the validity and legitimacy of the actual underlying asset class itself,” said Daniel Straus, director of ETFs and financial products research at National Bank Financial. “I’m worried that investors may make that mistake.”\nBitcoin’s step into the financial establishment doesn’t mean it will be any less volatile.\nBut in small weightings, bitcoin could help round out a portfolio. Over the past few years, traditional models of portfolio construction have come into question. The 60\/40 split between stocks and bonds, for example, is predicated on the idea that the two asset classes tend to counterbalance one another.\nThe problem is that stocks and bonds are moving in the same direction more often than they used to. This has fuelled an appetite for real assets, like commodities and real estate, to act as diversifiers. Bitcoin can be lumped into the same group, Mr. Taylor said.\n“I think crypto will probably start to make up a portion of that portion of the portfolio.”\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nEditorial code of conduct\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.","Related Stories\nOn Tuesday morning, bitcoin briefly reached an all-time high price of $69,210, according to Coin Metrics. It fell later that afternoon, but hovered around $66,400 as of 5 p.m. on Wednesday.\nThe new record had been a long time coming: It's been over two years since the cryptocurrency reached its previous high of around $68,982 on Nov. 10, 2021.\nOne factor that appears to be fueling bitcoin's recent rise is the debut of bitcoin ETFs. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing investors to purchase bitcoin ETFs through their brokerage accounts and gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to buy and store it themselves or through a crypto exchange.\nThe digital token's rise also helped boost the price of other virtual coins, including ether, which reached its highest price level since January 2022 on Wednesday.\nAlthough bitcoin's recent success may make it tempting to buy in, think carefully before adding it or any other cryptocurrency to your investment portfolio. Here's why.\nUnlike stocks and bonds, crypto's value isn't derived from an underlying entity, which is why it can be subject to erratic fluctuations and falls.\n\"There's no business or actual commodity of any kind backing this other than just supply and demand and what people are willing to pay for it,\" Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth, tells CNBC Make It. Boneparth invests in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe volatile nature of crypto can be \"stomach churning\" for new investors, he says.\n\"If they're not used to that, it could cause them to bail,\" Boneparth says. \"This is something that if you believe in it and have conviction, you're going to have to hold it for a long period of time.\"\nEven if you're able to tolerate the volatility, it's smart to tread carefully if you're thinking about buying crypto.\nThat starts with understanding that both bitcoin and the crypto market overall have taken major hits over the past two years. Bitcoin lost over 60% of its value in 2022, just one year after reaching its previous record high. The crypto market lost more than $2 trillion in value that same year.\nAlthough bitcoin's value has increased by around 45% year-to-date, as with any financial asset, its current performance shouldn't be used to predict how it may behave in the future.\nDue to crypto's unpredictability, financial experts advise against investing more money in the digital tokens than you're willing to potentially lose.\nWant to land your dream job in 2024? Take CNBC's new online course How to Ace Your Job Interview to learn what hiring managers are really looking for, body language techniques, what to say and not to say, and the best way to talk about pay.

On March 5th the crypto token rose to an all-time high of just above $69,000—a level sure to delight the meme-loving crypto-crowd—before slipping back a little. The record capped a remarkable comeback from the dark days of November 2022, when interest-rate rises were crushing risk appetite and ftx, a crypto exchange, had just gone bust. At the time, buying bitcoin on such exchanges seemed like little more than a fun and novel way to get robbed.\nBitcoin is hardly rallying in isolation: everything is going up. Stockmarkets all over the world are near record highs. So are gold prices. Even bond prices are climbing after a miserable two-year stretch. The catalyst is a combination of artificial-intelligence hype, joy at the state of the global economy and expectations of looser monetary policy to come.\nStill, bitcoin is doing better than most assets. On January 10th the Securities and Exchange Commission, an American regulator, approved applications by ten investment firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, to create bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These make it easier for everyday investors to buy the cryptocurrency. Rather than setting up an account with a specialist exchange, creating a crypto wallet, making a bank transfer and then finally buying bitcoin, people can now simply log on to their brokerage accounts and purchase an etf. Assets in the ten largest bitcoin etfs now come to around $50bn. And the activity appears to be self-reinforcing: the more money is poured in, the higher the price goes, the more people chatter about bitcoin etfs, the more money pours in and so on and so on.\nBitcoin has been in existence for 14 years. The elegant mechanism by which it validates itself and supply grows has never been hacked, meaning that the token is not going anywhere. Yet it is now obvious that it is of pretty limited use for payments, as it is restricted by both the high costs and slow speed of transactions. Those trying to build applications on top of blockchains are not doing so using bitcoin either. With the creation of etfs, it is now clear that bitcoin is an investment asset and nothing more. So after this initial surge of interest, what will its returns look like?\nIt would be foolish to extrapolate from bitcoin’s entire history. Over the past 14 years the cryptocurrency has morphed from a niche cyberpunk idea into something approaching a mainstream financial asset. Its more recent price movements might provide some clues, however. There are two explanations for them. One is that purchases are basically a broad bet on technological progress, with variations that reflect prospects for crypto itself. For instance, even as tech stocks soared in the middle of 2021, bitcoin slumped after Elon Musk posted negative tweets about crypto payments. Prices were depressed in late 2022, too, even as stockmarkets were rallying, owing to ftx’s failure.\nThe other theory is that bitcoin is a kind of digital gold. After all, supply is inherently limited, just as gold supply is restricted by the amount of the metal in the ground. Neither asset pays a yield or earns profits. This theory fell out of favour in 2021 and 2022, as inflation soared and bitcoin collapsed, but last year the cryptocurrency once again moved in line with gold.\nPerhaps both theories contain elements of truth. And a hybrid tech-stock-crypto-vibes-gold-bet asset could be useful in even pedestrian portfolios, especially if it is only somewhat correlated with other assets an investor might hold. Diversification among uncorrelated assets is the foundational principle of portfolio management. Reallocating, say, 1% of a fund to bitcoin would be a low-stakes hedge.\nIf investors buy this argument, bitcoin’s price is likely to rise for a while yet. What happens, then, when the cryptocurrency’s transition into a standard financial asset is complete? Assume that bitcoin has been added to most investor portfolios. Also assume that crypto tech does not really catch on. In this world, bitcoin’s returns probably do come to resemble those of gold: there is a fixed amount of it, and its price would rise over the long term roughly in line with the stock of money. That implies steady single-digit returns. The creation of a bitcoin etf may have set off a frenzy of eye-popping gains—but the future it portends could be slower and steadier.\n© 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

It was reportedly circulating on Microsoft’s Bing platform and was also shared on Facebook.\nAccording to a supposed article published on March 2 on a website imitating Inquirer.net, Tan had promoted the use of Etherum 800 Sprix, an automated trading platform for cryptocurrency, during an allegedly deleted interview with Abunda.\nA similar claim can be found on a Medium website, where Tan supposedly promoted another cryptocurrency trading platform called Trader Aloha 7.0 in an interview with Abunda in the talk show Gandang Gabi Vice!\nThe facts: None of the incidents were true. All parties – Abunda, Tan, and Inquirer.net – denied the false posts.\nTan denial: Tan, through a statement released by his office on March 5, clarified that he “is not, in any way, connected, involved, or engaged with any cryptocurrency trading.”\n“We condemn websites that use the name and photos of Dr. Tan without his permission as these are clearly sources of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news to push their websites’ malicious agenda of misleading and duping investors,” the statement said.\nBoy Abunda denial: Meanwhile, in a conversation with Rappler on March 4, Abunda denied interviewing Tan.\n“Of course I deny that I did an interview with Andrew Tan. It is alarming already,” Abunda said, adding that his name and image have often been used in such false advertisements.\nAccording to the television host, he has been alerted about a number of fake content which featured him supposedly interviewing different people.\n“This is probably because I am a known interviewer. Thus, it is easy for people to believe I conducted said interviews with various personalities,” he said.\nAdditionally, the Medium article bears a false detail as it is comedian and talk show host Vice Ganda, not Abunda, who hosts Gandang Gabi Vice!\nFake article: In a fact check article on January 24, Inquirer.net said it did not publish the supposed news article containing the claim.\n“We want to clarify that this is fake news.

Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $8.1 billion in assets, has generated a return of 25% for the past 12 months.\nThat lags the 40% return of the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. Ark funds holdings are virtually all tech stocks.\nArk Innovation’s annualized return is negative 24% for the past three years and a mere positive 3% for five years.\nThat compares unfavorably with positive 9% and positive 17% for the Nasdaq during those periods. Wood’s goal is for at least 15% annual returns over five-year stretches.\nPATRICK T. FALLON\/AFP via Getty Images\nWood’s investment strategy isn’t hard to fathom. Ark’s ETFs generally buy young, small-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. She views those areas as game changers for the global economy.\nRelated: Cathie Wood’s Ark is suffering from a discouraging trend\nThese stocks are quite volatile, of course, so the Ark funds are subject to rollercoaster rides. And Wood frequently trades in and out of her top names.\nInvestment research titan Morningstar is quite critical of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. “ARK Innovation has dubious ability to successfully navigate the challenging territory it explores,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote last year.\nThe potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” he said. “But Ark’s ability to spot the winners among them and navigate their myriad risks is less so. The strategy’s booms and busts have culminated in middling total returns and extreme volatility since its 2014 inception.”\nIt’s not an investment 101 portfolio. “The strategy narrowly invests in stocks with paltry current earnings, elevated valuations, and highly correlated stock prices,” Greengold said. “Their extreme volatility underscores their highly uncertain futures.”\nWood has defended herself from Morningstar’s criticism. “I do know there are companies like that one [Morningstar] that do not understand what we're doing,” she told Magnifi Media by Tifin in 2022.\n“We do not fit into their style boxes. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors.”\nBut some of Wood’s customers apparently agree with Morningstar. During Ark Innovation’s rally of the past 12 months, it saw a net investment outflow of $1.3 billion.\nOn Monday, Wood traded three stocks that she rarely touches. Ark Fintech Innovation ETF  (ARKF)  purchased 12,498 shares of social-media goliath Meta Platforms  (META) , valued at $6.2 million as of Monday’s close.\nFund manager buys and sells:\nWarren Buffett just sold shares of this popular streaming stock\nPaul Tudor Jones’ hedge fund just made a big bet on Nvidia stock\nStanley Druckenmiller just sold two AI tech stocks\nIt’s hard to argue that Wood got a bargain, given the stock’s 167% surge over the past 12 months. But artificial intelligence mania could easily push it still higher.\nArk Genomic Revolution ETF  (ARKG)  snagged 10,981 shares of biotechnology stalwart Amgen  (AMGN) , valued at $3.1 million as of Monday’s close. Amgen stock has dropped 15% since hitting a record Feb. 1, pressured by a disappointing earnings report.\nSo perhaps Wood picked up a bargain. The stock has climbed 18% over the past 12 months.\nMeanwhile, Ark Genomic dumped 84,636 shares of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer  (PFE) , valued at $2.2 million. How Pfizer fits into Wood’s investment philosophy is unclear. But the fund has only 35,282 shares left. The stock has tumbled 36% over the past year.\nAlso on the selling side, Ark funds unloaded 134,749 shares of Coinbase Global  (COIN) , the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. That cache was valued at $30.9 million as of Monday’s close.\nThe stock has skyrocketed 187% over the past six months amid the surge in cryptocurrencies. So Wood, who has sold it steadily during the past three weeks, may think now is a good time to take profits. She remains an evangelist for cryptocurrencies.\nThe author owns shares of Meta, Amgen and Pfizer.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"]}

But the grandfather of cryptocurrencies has since fallen about 3%, from around $69,000 to $67,000, at the time of publication. Still, bitcoin is up 6.5% on the week and 56% on the month. The second-largest crypto, ether, is up 9.7% on the week to $3,800, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market cap increased 7.7% during the same time frame to $2.53 trillion.\nSmaller tokens have also gained a lot of traction this past week. Solana-based dog-themed memecoins saw renewed interest after hype rose in December. Bonk and dogwifhat increased 15% and 115%, respectively, on the week.

Using gold ETFs as a guide, bitcoin funds could eventually hold $62 billion.\n\"In our opinion, this is a realistic target of the potential size of spot bitcoin ETFs over time perhaps within a period of two to three years, though much of the implied net inflow could represent a continued rotational shift from existing instruments and venues to ETFs,\" the analysts said.\nGet the latest Gold price here.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges"]}

It's on pace to end the week higher by 10%.\nThe up move began around the time the U.S. stock market opened. With the introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., big crypto moves now tend to take place during traditional stock trading hours.\nThe early advance may have been driven in part by investors who were weighing the February jobs report, hopeful that a higher unemployment rate and cooler than initially reported employment growth in December and January will clear the way for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates later this year.\nHowever, crypto trading has been especially volatile this week. After bitcoin reached a new record on Tuesday for the first time in more than two years, it quickly tumbled as much as 10%, pulling down other cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks along with it, then recovering much of those losses the next day.

Some information may no longer be current.\nBitcoin is back in the headlines, having roared to a new record high, just as many of the world’s major central banks are starting to pave the way towards cutting interest rates, but only if inflation behaves.\nInvestment flows into cryptocurrencies, inflation numbers from the United States, China and the UK, as well as a potentially market-moving snap election in Portugal will all be under the microscope in the coming week.\nHere is your week-ahead look at global markets:\nAn advertisement for Bitcoin cryptocurrency is displayed on a street in Hong Kong, on Feb. 17, 2022.Kin Cheung\/The Associated Press\nBitcoin has hit a new all-time high above $69,000, bringing it back to where it was in November 2021, when rates were low and “blockchain” and “Web3″ were all the rage.\nThat 2021 boom was followed by a “crypto winter” fraught with bankruptcies and collapses at the biggest crypto firms that left millions out of pocket. Various crypto executives were hit with criminal charges and regulators stepped up their warnings about the risks.\nBut this does not seem to have deterred a new wave of money from coming in. No one knows for sure what’s driving the gains, although analysts point to the billions of dollars that have flowed into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that launched this year.\nCrypto fans say the industry has matured, but central bankers and regulators are still wary. Now investors are wondering: how much bigger can it get and is it different this time?\nSigns advertise Black Friday deals at a Walmart in Secaucus, N.J., Nov. 22, 2022.Seth Wenig\/AP\nTuesday’s U.S. inflation report could help answer one of the key questions hovering over markets -- when can the Federal Reserve start cutting interest rates?\nThe consumer price index for February is expected to rise 0.4%, after January’s CPI rose at a faster-than-expected 0.3%.\nInvestors have dialled back expectations for the number of interest rate cuts in 2024 amid lingering concerns about strength in the economy reigniting inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in recent days that rate reductions will still “likely be appropriate” later this year, if officials gain more confidence in the steady decline of inflation.\nWith the fourth-quarter corporate earnings season ending, economic and inflation data is front and centre ahead of the Fed’s next meeting later in March.\nThis picture shows a general view of the Great Hall of the People before the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on March 8.PEDRO PARDO\/Getty Images\nInvestors weren’t throwing any parties after the opening of China’s week-long National People’s Congress, as Beijing announced a stable and as-expected 5% growth target for 2024, but didn’t break down what stimulus it would deploy to get the economy up and dancing.\nThe ailing property sector may be getting worse instead of better, with bonds in state-backed developer Vanke having sold off sharply. New home prices could fall further this year as support measures so far have had little impact, with the latest data due on March 15.\nThere is potentially room to loosen monetary policy, because although Chinese interest rates are already low compared with the U.S., the deflationary environment means real rates could come down. Inflation data on March 9 will offer fresh hints on how long this trend will continue.\nThe Bank of England is seen in London on July 30, 2023.Hollie Adams\/Reuters\nBritain’s economy has narrowly avoided recession, as business activity is expanding at a healthy clip and consumers hit the shops in earnest - even with interest rates at 16-year highs and persistent inflation.\nThe Bank of England is less concerned about growth and far more focussed on inflation. The jobs market is showing signs of moderating. Vacancies fell for the 19th time in a row in the three months to January. But businesses are still struggling to find and retain staff. High levels of long-term sickness are also hampering employers.\nAverage regular pay - key for the BoE - decelerated to a rate of 6.2% in December, the slowest pace of growth in over a year, but not slow enough to convince policymakers rates will need to fall sooner rather than later. Data on March 12 might shift that thinking.\nPeople wait for Socialist Party (PS) Secretary General Pedro Nuno Santos to arrive for a campaign rally ahead of the snap elections in Afurada, Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal, March 4.Pedro Nunes\/Reuters\nPortugal holds its second snap election in two years on Sunday. In the past, such uncertainty and political instability would have unnerved investors.\nYet the premium they demand to hold Portuguese bonds over top-rated Germany is at the lowest in a year, around 134 bps. Sentiment towards Portuguese debt (and southern Europe) is positive.\nRatings agency S&P Global just raised Portugal’s rating to “A-” from “BBB+”, citing an improved debt outlook and saying a change in government shouldn’t alter that trajectory.\nSo is this a “nothing to see” election? Not exactly.\nSunday’s vote is unlikely to produce a clear winner. The far-right Chega is expected to get 15%-20% of vote, possibly becoming kingmaker.\nWith EU-wide elections in June, the growing success of the far right and the impact of populism is one to watch.\nBe smart with your money.

This time around, however, President Biden's 2025 budget is attracting quite a lot of eyeballs from the crypto sphere, courtesy of a line item embedded toward the end of the voluminous financial document that illustrates the US government's projections vis-a-vis Bitcoin.\nBREAKING🚨 Biden's 2025 budget is very bullish on #Bitcoin , the White House expects $250k by 2035.\nThey are counting on it for their tax revenues! pic.twitter.com\/JOipF3PKpG\n— Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) March 11, 2024\nRiot Platform's VP of Research, Pierre Rochard, recently distilled the US government's revenue projections from the regulation and taxation of digital assets into the theoretical price of Bitcoin that underpins those estimates. As per his findings, the US Office of Management and Budget expects Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by 2034 - 2035. If you wish to examine that line item yourself, head over to page 163 of this document.\nBasically, Rochard divides the revenue that the US government expects to generate from digital assets in 2025 ($1.035 billion) by Bitcoin's current price of around $72,000. He then multiplies the result by the revenue of $3.65 billion that the government expects to generate in 2035, leading to an end result of $254,158 as the expected price of one Bitcoin. Critically, this analysis ignores any improvements in the government's regulatory or taxation capacity in relation to digital assets in driving up the revenue projections.\nBREAKING 🚨 Biden expects the #Bitcoin mining industry to 10x in the United States over the next decade, this would imply $6 million price target for #BTC . Even more bullish than the wash trading line item.\nAmerican dynamism and energy abundance will make this possible! pic.twitter.com\/f1IEDabpsm\n— Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) March 11, 2024\nBy applying the same approach to the budget's projections for digital asset mining excise tax, Rochard arrives at an estimated assumed price of around $6 million for one Bitcoin by 2033.\nWe noted earlier today that Bitcoin has now formed a new all-time high on the back of a confluence of benevolent tailwinds, which include soaring inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy's ongoing Bitcoin purchases, and the upcoming halving event and the deflationary forces that it is expected to unleash.\n\"I think Bitcoin makes a beeline back towards its long-term trend line, which is probably $82,000 in the near term, $150,000 before year-end,\" says @fundstrat's Tom Lee as $BTC closes in on its all-time high. pic.twitter.com\/g4p6VOTECx\n— Last Call (@LastCallCNBC) March 5, 2024\nEven if we assume that Rochard's rudimentary calculations paint a correct picture, the underlying assumptions in relation to the $250,000 price of Bitcoin are likely to be very conservative. After all, based on Bitcoin's current momentum, it can certainly hit the $100,000 price level within the next few months. In fact, Fundstrat's Tom Lee expects Bitcoin to close the year at a price of around $150,000.\nWhat's more, some analysts, such as André Dragosch, ETC Group's head of research, are now openly calling for Bitcoin to usurp the primacy of Gold as the premier safe-haven asset. Based on the two assets ' stock-to-flow ratios, Dragosch posits that Bitcoin will become double as scarce as Gold in the post-halving phase. Consequently, the analyst contends that the world's pre-eminent cryptocurrency will eventually overtake Gold's AUM. To do so, however, it will have to reach a price level of around $600,000.\nNote: The article has been updated with the insight related to the $6 million price tag for Bitcoin.",null,"Oops, something went wrong\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) on Monday surged above $72,000, a new all-time high, but that’s far from the peak expected by some who track the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\nLender Standard Chartered anticipates bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of the year.

This has now placed it ahead of silver (valued at $1.387 trillion), according to CompaniesMarketCap.\nDuring its historic bull run, Bitcoin had already exceeded the market cap of Meta, now valued at $1.2 trillion. The next target in Bitcoin's ascent is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, currently valued just below $1.7 trillion, the CoinDesk report said.\nIt noted that Bitcoin enthusiasts are setting their sights on gold, the world's most valuable asset with a market cap of $14.7 trillion. Achieving this milestone would require Bitcoin to increase more than tenfold, surpassing $720,000 per token.\nBitcoin has continued its unprecedented surge, driven by a substantial influx of capital into crypto products and the imminent reduction in the digital token's supply growth, as per a Bloomberg report.\nIt achieved an all-time peak of nearly $72,881 on March 11 and maintained a robust position at $72,165 as of 11:25 a.m. in Singapore on March 12. A recent report by CoinShares International revealed a record $2.7 billion inflow into crypto assets last week, with a significant portion directed towards Bitcoin. Both the token and a gauge of the largest 100 coins have seen a remarkable 70 percent increase in value this year.\nThe success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in the United States on January 11 has been a pivotal factor in driving recent momentum, the Bloomberg report added. ETFs from BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, with a combined net inflow of approximately $9.5 billion, have played a crucial role.\nIn the UK, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) announced its acceptance of applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes, while Thailand's securities regulator signalled the opening of overseas crypto ETFs to retail buyers.\n\"We are witnessing institutional adoption in the US,\" stated Ophelia Snyder, co-founder, and president of 21Shares, on Bloomberg Television. She added, \"It's quite early still. Not all institutions, not all wirehouses, have access to it.\"\nBitcoin's rally is creating around 1,500 new \"millionaire wallets\" daily, as reported by crypto analytics firm Kaiko Research. However, the exact ownership distribution between individuals and companies is challenging to determine based on blockchain data. This daily creation rate is lower than during the 2021 bull run when over 4,000 wallets per day reached the million-dollar mark.\nNext month, Bitcoin is set to undergo a significant event known as the halving, which involves cutting the supply of new Bitcoin in half. The combination of ETF demand, limited supply, and expectations of looser monetary policy contributes to bullish sentiment in the crypto market, overshadowing memories of the challenging 2022 bear market.\n(With inputs from Bloomberg)\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

It added that exchanges must have sufficient controls in place, “so trading is orderly and proper protection is afforded to professional investors.” The FCA also said a ban on retail investors from buying crypto-linked ETNs or derivatives remains in place because they are too risky.\nAfter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January, allowing investors to trade crypto with less risk, new investors have entered the crypto market — and the price of bitcoin has been on the rise. Last week, bitcoin briefly surpassed its previous record high from 2021 when it surged to $69,191.95. But ETFs are different from ETNs, as ETFs are a fund-holding asset, while an ETN is an unsecured debt note issued by a bank.\nBitcoin investors are also anticipating the currency’s “halving” event next month, which is expected to keep Bitcoin’s price surging over the next few months. The event happens every four years, and sees Bitcoin miners earning only half the reward for minting new Bitcoin. That means the reward will be cut from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125. The event, which was written into the cryptocurrency’s code to protect it from inflation, will continue until Bitcoin reaches a cap of 21 million. After every 210,000 blocks are added to the chain, the reward is cut in half to slow down the pace of adding new Bitcoin to circulation.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Cryptocurrency rises as UK financial regulator says it will allow trading of crypto-backed securities\nBitcoin has reached a new record price of almost $73,000 (£57,000), as the UK financial regulator said it would allow the trading of cryptocurrency-backed securities.\nThe cryptocurrency hit a fresh high of $72,720 as of Monday evening having last week overtaken its previous November 2021 high of nearly $69,000.\nThe latest price move came as the UK financial regulator said on Monday it would “not object” to investment exchanges creating a UK-listed market segment for cryptoasset-backed exchange traded notes [cETNs], a financial product that can be traded like a stock.\nHowever, the Financial Conduct Authority said it would not permit the sale of the cETNs to retail investors, or members of the public.\n“The FCA continues to remind people that cryptoassets are high risk and largely unregulated. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money,” it said in a statement.\nBitcoin has been helped this year by the US financial regulator approving exchange-traded funds [ETFs] – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – that track the price of the cryptocurrency.\nThe chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, also expressed scepticism about bitcoin despite the approval, referring to it in January as a “speculative, volatile asset” used for illicit activities including ransomware and terrorist financing.\nAn upcoming “halving” of bitcoin, in which the amount of new bitcoin being generated is reduced, is also expected to support the currency by causing a reduction in supply – and therefore bolstering the price.\nNeil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage Finalto, said the FCA move was a “positive” sign for the cryptocurrency market. He added that “parabolic” market moves – referring to sharp price increases – tended to end in a big pullback but “we cannot be sure with bitcoin any more”.\n“There is a question of the amount of spare cash sitting around that can be allocated to it,” he added."]}

However, as its own business entity, Coinbase features its own distinct risk-reward profile. As such, a short-term trading approach may be preferable as investors ride this wave. I lean bullish on COIN stock based on the data.\nUndeniably, COIN stock has been a strong asset for bullish speculators. Since the beginning of the year, shares have gained almost 64%. Over the past 52 weeks, they gained nearly 330%, a remarkable ascent. Obviously, the optimism aligns with the underlying cryptocurrency market.\nAs an accessible platform, Coinbase is effectively the gateway for everyday investors to participate in the crypto narrative. Because of its custodial nature, the company helps to mitigate some of the harsh pain points of the crypto ecosystem, including lost passwords that have locked out people from millions of dollars worth of crypto riches.\nStill, virtual currencies suffer from an ongoing legislative question about how to regulate them. Further, crypto exchanges can just implode overnight. Without regulation, there is no protection—and that, of course, frightens prospective crypto investors. So, COIN stock offers an alternative, thanks to its general correlation with the blockchain ecosystem.\nGenerally, I believe in this narrative. However, I would also be remiss not to point out some concerns about COIN stock.\nFirst and foremost, Coinbase is its own business. And that means that even if cryptos soar to even more blistering heights, if Coinbase incurs problems unique to the organization, then COIN stock is liable to “break” the positive correlation.\nSecond, legal questions hang over the company, even if the blockchain space enjoyed a major win with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Therefore, during some cycles, COIN stock might not reliably correlate with the crypto market.\nThird, TipRanks currently notes that its Insider Confidence Signal sits at “negative.” Most conspicuously, Coinbase Chairman and CEO Brian Armstrong placed an Informative Sell on COIN stock last month. To be fair, executives sell their shares for a variety of reasons, many of them mundane. Nevertheless, the move may raise some ambiguity over COIN’s future trajectory.\nFor those investors who want to participate in COIN stock but are unsure about making a long-term commitment, a short-term approach may be preferable. Two main advantages exist for this line of thinking.\nFirst, traders focus on the immediate sentiment of the market without getting bogged down with wider fundamental issues. Second, the exposure is limited in case of severe volatility: this is a quick-in, quick-out approach rather than a buy-hold-hope approach.\nTo get the most out of COIN stock for short-term trading, investors may want to consider conditional probability analyses — that is, probabilities calculated on the basis of another event occurring.\nThere are many ways to approach conditional probabilities, but one that I find helpful with COIN stock is trading based on whether the opening price of a session is above or below the prior session’s closing price. Between October 2 and March 8, there have been 110 sessions, with 52 sessions seeing the opening price in the red.\nAmong the 52 sessions, 30 saw the closing price end up higher than the opening price. That means roughly 58% of the time, based on recent trading dynamics, traders can look for the buy signal (COIN stock opening lower than the prior day’s price) and potentially have better-than-coin-toss odds of winning.\nEven better, during the last five times the “opener-down, closer-up” pattern materialized, COIN stock enjoyed an average same-day return of 2.24%.\nLeveraging this information, traders can plug in key assumptions in an options calculator to determine the prospective trade’s viability. As well, they can input hypothetical downside price targets to understand the possible risks and rewards.\nAround April 19, Bitcoin will undergo what’s known as a halving event. To make a long story short, the rewards for mining the cryptocurrency will be halved. Theoretically, this event should negatively impact supply against a hot commodity. That should be bullish on paper.\nNevertheless, there’s also the fear of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” It’s quite possible that after the halving, cryptos could sharply correct. Interestingly, the put\/call volume ratio for COIN stock options spiked to 3.19 for derivatives expiring on April 26.\nSo, word to the wise: the crypto market may continue to undergird an upward bias in COIN stock up until the halving. After the event, there may be some near-term choppiness or outright volatility.\nTurning to Wall Street, COIN stock has a Hold consensus rating based on nine Buys, nine Holds, and five Sell ratings. The average COIN stock price target is $182.95, implying 28% downside risk.\nWith cryptocurrencies soaring, COIN stock has ridden the sector’s coattails. The data is clear about that. However, outside fundamentals present some questions about buying and holding Coinbase shares. To mitigate these concerns, traders may consider a short-term approach by exploiting the upward bias in the security.\nDisclosure","Crypto bull Michael Saylor has been on a bitcoin-buying spree, and he thinks the digital currency is on pace to replace gold.\n\"Bitcoin is certainly at least digital gold,\" Saylor said in a CNBC interview on Monday. \"It's going to eat gold. It's got all of the great attributes of gold and none of the defects of gold.\"\nSaylor used one well-established argument: that bitcoin's digital nature makes it easy to move across the world in mere seconds, as opposed to a physical asset like gold.\n\"Bitcoin is a superior investment to gold, equity bonds and real estate because it's digital,\" Saylor said. \"You can trade it a million times faster than conventional assets using a computer. It's available. Most other assets trade less than 20% of the time. Bitcoin is trading 168 hours a week.\"\nSaylor — the chairman and cofounder of MicroStrategy — pivoted the firm into a bitcoin-buying operation in 2020, and has amassed 205,000 tokens worth more than $14 billion as the cryptocurrency has surged more than 1,000%. MicroStrategy bought an additional 12,000 bitcoin this week, one of its largest single purchases on record.\nBitcoin has enjoyed a record-setting run of late, surging above the $72,000 level for the first time on Monday. The gains have come amid increased demand following the approval of an array of bitcoin ETFs, and as investors preapred for the upcoming halving event that will reduce supply.\nJPMorgan pointed out in a recent research note that the shift away from gold, towards bitcoin, is already taking place. On a volume-adjusted basis, and at its current price, bitcoin already makes up a larger allocation of investor portfolios than gold, the firm said.\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nGet the latest Gold price here.",null]}

The original – and still biggest – cryptocurrency surged to a record high of more than $72,000 (€66,000) on Monday, having more than tripled in value in the space of a year. Other crypto tokens, such as ethereum and dogecoin – beloved by Elon Musk – have also been rallying, with the estimated value of the market climbing to above $2.7 trillion for the first time in more than two years.\nThe funny thing is, though, that there’s a chance you have actually not heard. There’s not so much talk about which token is next going “to da moon” or so many instances of “Wen Lambo?” this time around.\nNewspapers aren’t running stories about how hilariously rich everyone is getting apart from you. Worldwide search traffic for “bitcoin” and “crypto” has climbed in recent days but it is still only about half the level it was the last time a record was hit in 2021, according to Google Trends.\nNo, crypto in 2024 (so far, at least) is a rather more subdued affair. And the reason is that the factors reckoned to be driving rising prices are far from the kind of wild crazes we’ve seen before, such as the mania for initial coin offerings in 2017 or for non-fungible tokens in 2021.\nInstead, there are some rather more prosaic things going on. These are: supply and demand dynamics in the lead-up to the “halving” expected in April, when the number of new bitcoins mined every 10 minutes halves to 3.125; the prospect of lower interest rates; and institutional capital flows into the 11 bitcoin-based exchange traded funds approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year.\nThe last factor is probably having the most impact. More than $50 billion has poured into bitcoin ETFs, according to data from crypto platform The Block, with the one launched by BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, already the firm’s third-biggest exchange-traded product and the fastest ETF ever to reach $10 billion.\nSome of the world’s biggest banks – Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America – are reportedly lining up to get involved in bitcoin, too. (The painful lessons of the financial crisis, about avoiding high-risk, toxic assets, have been forgotten, it seems.)\nThe buyers using these new ETFs are conventional investors who see it as a way of diversifying, rather than true believers. So you might think bitcoiners would be unimpressed by their anarchic cryptocurrency – whose raison d’être is, it seems, to circumvent such middlemen and provide a decentralised, censorship-resistant form of money – being overtaken by the world of traditional finance. Bitcoin has always been about sticking it to the man, surely, not making rich banker-men richer.\nBut you would be wrong. “The OTC desks are running out of $BTC. This is why we are pumping so hard. Institutional FOMO is starting now, $100k will come very soon,” posted one much-followed crypto account on X. “I’ve become pro-ETF, because ... anyone who’s got some kind of exposure is now incentivised to be Team Bitcoin,” said Peter McCormack recently on his What Bitcoin Did podcast. “Let’s just say it’s good to have [BlackRock chief executive] Larry Fink on your side. This is the great thing about bitcoin – all our incentives align.”\nHe’s right, of course: when something is backed only by belief, you want as many believers as you can get. But this does rather give the game away about what motivates people to be on “Team Bitcoin”.\nThe institutional investors entering the market do not believe bitcoin is the future of money, nor that it will revolutionise and overthrow the financial system; these companies are the financial system. They buy bitcoin because they calculate they can eke out extra returns by doing so. Furthermore, Fink is not really Team Bitcoin at all – he has said he also “see[s] value” in an ethereum ETF.\nThe reality is that the embrace of crypto by the world of traditional finance, or “TradFi”, as crypto types like to call it, is just as hypocritical as crypto’s embrace of institutional investors. I heard one of the hosts of another bitcoin-focused podcast, the Wolf of All Streets, say recently that “TradFi is just as degen” – a crypto word describing a reckless (and degenerate) gambler – “as the crypto community is” and this, unfortunately, is not wholly unjustified.\nWith the advent of bitcoin ETFs, what was once a relatively clear boundary between crypto and conventional finance has been broken down for good. And the world of TradFi has shown the emptiness of its talk of learning the lessons of the financial crisis. It has shown that – like the world of crypto – it is really just as greedy as ever. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024\nGet the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning","Bitcoin's record-breaking spree is spurring windfall profits for cryptocurrency miners, with industry revenues reaching all-time highs, Deutsche Bank said in a research note.\nOn Monday, daily mining revenue hit a new peak of $78 million a day, climbing in unison with the ongoing bitcoin rally. That same day, the token surged past a $72,000 record threshold, though analysts expect even higher price levels this year.\nDriving the rebound is Wall Street's emerging embrace of the asset, with 11 spot bitcoin ETFs launched in mid-January. The success of these funds is spurring even more institutions to jump into the race, including Wells Fargo and Merrill.\nOther tailwinds are yet to come, and include regulatory changes, loosening monetary policy, and the highly anticipated halving, Deutsche said.\nThe latter, a four-year event that reduces the amount of bitcoin awarded to successful miners, is pushing firms to acquire new capital. Since February 2023, 13 firms have invested $1 billion in specialized computers and equipment, meant to boost operations.\nIt's crucial that miners invest in such upgrades, as halving cycles often cut into profit-taking, leading to firm fallout and consolidation.\n\"The last halving took place in May 2020, reducing the miner reward from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins per block. Miners saw their profits significantly reduced overnight. Many were forced to shut down outdated rigs that became unprofitable to operate,\" Deutsche wrote.\nThe next halving is scheduled for April of this year, and will reduce awarded bitcoins to just 3.125. Fierce competition is already evident in rising bitcoin energy consumption, which rose to its highest since September 2022 in annualized terms, the bank said.\nBut for bitcoin investors, the halving cycle should enflame the price rally.\n\"In the 30 days prior to the November 2012 halving, prices rose by 5%. A more substantial 13% gain was seen ahead of the July 2016 event.

Accordingly, one might expect Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) to follow suit, given their exposure to rising prices. Unfortunately, though, MARA stock is down nearly 10% today. That brings its losses over the past month to almost 40%.\nThe question has to be asked: What gives? After all, the Bitcoin hoard on Marathon’s balance sheet and its ongoing BTC mining operations should benefit from higher prices.\nLet’s dive into what the market is watching and why there’s a bifurcation building among certain Bitcoin-related stocks.\nOne key catalyst driving BTC higher is Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event, which is set to take place some time in April. This halving will slash the rewards that miners like Marathon Digital receive from validating transactions on the network, helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain.\nSo, in theory — assuming all else is held equal (which it isn’t, we’ll get to that in a second) — the price of BTC would need to double for companies like Marathon to see the same revenue and earnings from operations.\nThankfully, companies like Marathon Digital have been expanding mining capacity in a bid to take market share as other miners duck out of the market. But that’s a capital-intensive process. And analysts now expect that this halving could shave off as much as $64 million worth of daily revenue for such companies. More capital intensity and less revenue isn’t a good mix — that’s an easy bearish thesis to understand.\nSo, the question then becomes how quickly will Bitcoin double from here? After hitting previous all-time highs, doublings have historically taken place within about a month of hitting previous highs. Therefore, maybe MARA stock could present a speculative buy for those who think things will turn out okay.\nHowever, right now, the market appears to be taking a cautious approach to MARA stock. I think that’s the right perspective. Until Bitcoin really breaks out above $100,000 per coin, this company could continue to see selling pressure in the near term.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Assuming that Bitcoin is able to maintain its current sector weight of 55 percent, this projection would see the price of the world's pre-eminent cryptocurrency rise to around $210,000.\nOf course, in the ongoing pre-halving phase, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are playing a critical role in boosting the bullish momentum in Bitcoin and, as a second-order derivative, the broader crypto sphere. These ETFs have now collectively attracted $11.82 billion in net inflows, which have swelled their total net assets to $60.96 billion as of the 13th of March.\nConsider the fact that Bitcoin's mining activity is currently producing around 6,300 tokens every week. In contrast, these spot Bitcoin ETFs are gobbling up roughly 40,000 tokens weekly, which equates to an imbalance of 6.35x.\nWe noted in a post earlier this week that, based on the assumptions embedded in the 2025 US budget document, the US administration expects Bitcoin to hit a price of between $250,000 and $6 million in around a decade. However, if Bernstein's projections for 2025 pan out, the upper bound in the budget document's assumptions would appear much more likely.\nBernstein STARTS coverage of Robinhood with an 'Outperform' rating and a PT of $30, citing a \"MONSTER\" crypto cycle.\nDeutsche Bank RAISES $HOOD PT to $16 from $12, CITING, 'Positive transaction revenue outlook from February metrics.' https:\/\/t.co\/Z4uKMyuIRd pic.twitter.com\/IAD96a8UJ3\n— Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) March 14, 2024\nMeanwhile, Bernstein has also raised its target on Robinhood shares to $30, equating to an upside potential of around 83 percent. As of February 2024, the brokerage firm boasted 23.6 million funded customers, with the volume of crypto notional transactions reaching $6.5 billion over the month. Bernstein analysts believe that Robinhood can grow its crypto revenues by 9.0x through 2025 vs. the 5.0x consensus.","Robinhood stock could be a big beneficiary of the bitcoin boom that's revitalizing the crypto market, with one analyst eyeing a jump of as much as 66% as customers of the popular trading app buy and sell more tokens.\n\"What we expect now is the risk-on side of the market to turn on, and I think crypto is going to play a big part of that,\" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said in a CNBC interview. \"We expect the crypto market to triple from here to go to almost $7.5 trillion in terms of market cap.

However, to the surprise of the investors, gold price and Bitcoin prices too witnessed selling pressure in the week gone by. According to experts, the Indian stock market witnessed selling pressure due to the 'shar test' being suggested by the mutual funds' body AMFI to the AMCs after the market regulator SEBI raised concern over the froth building up in the small and mid-cap stocks. They said that global cues also went negative after the hotter-than-expected US CPI and PPI print for February 2024. This dragged key benchmark indices, which include large-cap quality stocks as well. The disappointing US inflation data put down the probability of a near-term US Fed interest rate cut that dragged gold prices. They said that the decentralized digital currency market lacked a clear outlook after the weak macroeconomic developments amid rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East. This triggered profit booking in Bitcoin holdings.\nOn reasons for the synchronized movement of the stock market, gold, and Bitcoin prices, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin said, \"Historically, these assets have often moved independently of each other due to their different characteristics and drivers. Gold is traditionally considered a safe-haven asset that is sought after in times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Stocks, on the other hand, represent ownership stakes in companies and are influenced by factors such as company earnings, economic growth, and investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, has been touted as both a store of value and a speculative asset. However, in recent market conditions, observers have noted a surprising correlation between these seemingly disparate assets.\"\nAlso Read: Stocks to buy: Experts recommend these 10 shares to buy on Monday\n\"Several factors may contribute to this phenomenon. For example, macroeconomic events such as central bank policy, geopolitical tensions, and the global economic outlook could affect investor behavior across different asset classes. Additionally, the rise of algorithmic trading and the increasing integration of financial markets could strengthen correlations between assets. In addition, the narrative surrounding inflation concerns and the search for alternative stores of value amid unprecedented monetary stimulus may drive investors toward gold, stocks, and bitcoin at the same time. Whatever the underlying reasons, understanding the dynamics of this convergence could provide valuable insights for investors navigating today's complex financial environment,\" the Unocoin expert added.\nEdul Patel, CEO of Mudrex said, \"Gold, Equities, and Bitcoin are all moving together because of several different reasons. However, one common thing was that investors were anticipating the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. But when US inflation rose to 3.2% which is higher than expected, it affected these assets as the market tends to react much to unexpected things. Before the US inflation data came out, all these assets were doing well. While short-term fluctuations may occur, investors tend to return to the market after assessing the broader economic landscape.\"\nAsked about the reasons that forced Bitcoins to follow equity and gold price movement, Anuj Gupta, Head — Commodity & Currency at HDFC Securities said, \"It was liquidity and momentum that fueled these assets together. Bitcoin prices followed an uptrend after the boost in demand for Bitcoin ETF as the majority of the global central banks were buying gold. This triggered demand for Bitcoin in the decentralized digital currency market. However, hotter-than-expected US CPI data followed by the weak PPI print put a dent on the US Fed interest rate hike buzz in the near term.\"\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and broking companies, not of Mint.

It’s unclear what caused the price drop, but analysts consider it a healthy correction.\nBitcoin has been on the rise this year, breaking out of the crypto winter and reaching new all-time highs. This year alone the price has increased by more than 50%, reaching its highest point at $73,000 earlier this week. The jump in the price was primarily due to the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by the U.K.’s permission to list Bitcoin-linked securities on the stock market. The positive momentum spread across the market, skyrocketing the prices of other cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, the largest cryptocurrency may be ready for a cool-off phase, experts say. Digital asset analytics firm Swissblock said in a Telegram channel that Bitcoin’s price almost doubled to $38,000 in late January without any significant pullbacks, and so a cooling period may be on the horizon. In a note, Swissblock mentioned that the price of Bitcoin could go to $58,000-$59,000 in the next move, representing a 20% decline.\nAmid the volatility of Bitcoin, a software firm and Bitcoin maximalist MicroStrategy is planning to buy more Bitcoins. On Wednesday, it filed to raise $500 million in a convertible debt offering, so that it can buy more Bitcoin.

The price had rebounded to about $68,900 on Friday afternoon.\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the drop in bitcoin, which trades 24 hours a day.\nBitcoin is still up about 60% year to date, and the overnight drop came from near record highs. The cryptocurrency has climbed over the past few months, in part due to anticipation and then demand from the new bitcoin ETFs that launched in the U.S. in January.\n\"I think it's a healthy move. We're removing some of the leverage that has built up in the system,\" Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday, adding that the selling pressure was likely coming from the options market.\nRapid rallies and steep drops have been a recurring feature of bitcoin's history. In its previous bull market, bitcoin surged above $68,000 in November 2021 but was trading below the $20,000 mark roughly a year later.\nCrypto optimists say that the volatility of the asset class should decline as bitcoin matures. The advent of the bitcoin ETFs, which makes it easier for a wider swath of investors to gain exposure to crypto, could in theory help reduce that volatility.","Two tokens stand out as potential leaders in 2024: Retik Finance (RETIK) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

The platform's emphasis on security and reliability, underscored by a thorough audit conducted by Certik, a reputable blockchain security firm, has instilled confidence among investors. This commitment to safety, combined with a user-friendly interface, makes Retik Finance an attractive option for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Retik Finance actively nurtures its community through a range of strategic initiatives, including the recent $333,000 giveaway event.

While initially inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu has carved out its own niche in the market, fueled by a dedicated following and a series of strategic initiatives. With an ecosystem that includes decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and even its own blockchain network, Shiba Inu is positioning itself for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. Pepe Coin (PEPE), although less well-known than Retik Finance and Shiba Inu, is a rising star in its own right. With a focus on meme-inspired art and decentralized applications (dApps), Pepe Coin has attracted attention for its unique approach to blending humor and technology. As interest in NFTs (non-fungible tokens) continues to soar, Pepe Coin could capitalize on this trend and emerge as a major player in the crypto market. Looking ahead to 2024, all three tokens—Retik Finance, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin—are poised for significant growth. However, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and exercise caution, as the crypto market can be volatile and unpredictable.

Michael, who is stepping down to focus on other opportunities, will serve in an advisory role through March 2025.\nBakkt, which is backed by the parent company of the NYSE, said in February it may not be able to continue as a going concern. Since then, the company entered into a $40 million registered direct offering with institutional investors and a $10 million concurrent registered direct offering, which have “alleviated the conditions that raise the doubt about us as a going concern,” Main said in an interview.\nIntercontinental Exchange Inc., which owns some of the biggest futures markets as well as the NYSE, launched Bakkt with much fanfare in 2018, announcing that it was teaming up at the time in the venture with Starbucks Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Kelly Loeffler, the founding CEO, later went on to serve as a US Senator from Georgia for one year.\nThe company is also cutting expenses, such as restructuring services from external providers and eliminating an unnecessary duplicate license and related capital requirements, Main said. He also plans to grow the company’s revenue through partnerships.\n“The tailwinds are very strong at the moment, and the addressable market that Bakkt can go after is fairly sizable,” Main said.\nUntil 2022, Main was CEO of Ogilvy, an advertising, marketing and public relations firm. Before then, he headed Deloitte Digital, the digital consultancy branch of Deloitte, where he oversaw the acquisition of multiple creative agencies to grow the brand.\nOn March 14, Bakkt filed a notice of delisting with the Securities and Exchange Commission after being notified the prior day by the NYSE that it’s not in compliance because of low share price.

This bullish trend is expected to persist in the foreseeable future. Additionally, BTC is projected to hit a cycle high of $250,000 before stabilizing around $200,000 next year.\n“We think the gold analogy – in terms of both ETF impact and the optimal portfolio mix – remains a good starting point for estimating the ‘correct’ BTC price level medium-term,” the bank said in its note.\nIt further added, “If ETF inflows reach our mid-point estimate of $75billlion, and\/or if reserve managers buy BTC, we see a good chance of an overshoot to the $250,000 level at some stage in 2025.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin records largest single-day drop in two weeks, falls over 7%\nThe bank conducted its analysis by juxtaposing the price of gold following the introduction of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and establishing a correlation between ETF inflows and the price of BTC. Notably, spot bitcoin ETFs commenced trading in the U.S. in January.\nAdditionally, the bank projected that the Securities and Exchange Commission might sanction an ether (ETH) ETF by May 23, potentially resulting in inflows of up to $45 billion within the inaugural 12 months. Consequently, the bank envisages ETH reaching approximately $8,000 by the conclusion of 2024.\n\"In 2025, we see the ETH-to-BTC price ratio rising back to the 7% level that prevailed for much of 2021-22. Given our estimated BTC price level of USD 200,000 at end-2025, that would imply an ETH price of $14,000,\"the bank said in another note.\nLast week saw unprecedented levels of weekly net inflows and trading volume for US spot bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with bitcoin reaching new all-time highs before experiencing a notable retreat.\nAccording to reports, the combined net inflows for the ten spot bitcoin ETFs totaled $2.57 billion during the week.

While trading volumes have risen smartly, they are well below their peaks of a couple of years ago. At the same time, heavy taxation and negative sentiment from regulators have forced India's crypto companies to cut costs including jobs, and plan expansion into other lines of business.\nOn Wednesday, Bitcoin, the world’s most-valued cryptocurrency token by market cap, hit a record high of over $73,600, recording a threefold surge in prices in a span of six months.\nIndian exchanges’ volumes have climbed on cue. Crypto exchange WazirX’s daily average trading volume recovered to $3.4 million in February from about $780,000 in September, show data from consultancy firm Crebaco Global. CoinDCX’s daily average trading volume improved to $2.7 million from $750,000 over the same period.\nOn Wednesday, WazirX’s daily crypto trades were at $13.2 million, the first time since May 2022 that it has crossed $10 million per day, per crypto market tracker Coingecko. On Thursday, daily trades were at a marginally lower $9.9 million. CoinDCX’s trading volume was at $7.2 million on Thursday and $7.5 million on Wednesday, up about 3x from February’s daily average trading volumes.\nStill, the average trading volumes for both the exchanges are far below their peaks. WazirX’s trading volume is down 93% from its peak average trading volume of $47.2 million reached in March 2022, Crebaco’s data show. For CoinDCX, volumes were down by nearly 85% from their peak of $16.9 million in February 2022.\nIndustry experts attribute a wide number of factors to this, including apprehension among retail investors triggered by a lack of regulatory clarity, India’s crypto taxation policy, and statements against the cryptocurrency sector by senior government officials.\n“We are in an early phase of this present crypto bull run. The trajectory, sentiment and overall demand is good—our customer acquisition and KYC teams are struggling to cope up with demand from retail investors. But aggressive taxation is why retail investor sentiment is subdued,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice-president at WazirX.\nAshish Singhal, cofounder and chief executive of homegrown crypto exchange aggregator Coinswitch, said bulk traders may not return as long as heavy taxation persists. “The taxation issue remains a question mark for India’s retail users. While the early revival of trade volumes was driven by a limited subset of retail investors, bulk users will not return until they’re more assured of the state of the industry,\" said Singhal.\n“This is because the TDS (tax deducted at source) rate applicable for crypto trades in India means that a regular investor will be needed to fetch new capital every day instead of earning through arbitrage and being able to use earned margins for further trading,\" he added. “This is blocking the return of bulk daily and monthly trading volumes, which remain far lower than the highs of 2021 and early 2022,\" he said.\nOn 11 January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ETFs (exchange-traded funds) for Bitcoin tokens, a much-awaited development that had triggered a crypto rally in anticipation. Since then, global investment majors have acquired significant Bitcoin assets under management.\nOver the past two months, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has acquired $15.4 billion in bitcoin holdings, show data from market tracker Blockworks. Grayscale’s bitcoin holdings were at $27.7 billion and Fidelity’s at $9.2 billion as of 14 March.\nFor the crypto community, especially in India, such Bitcoin holdings add stability to an asset long considered too volatile for institutional investments.\n“Peak retail investments will likely wait until a further astronomical price hike for Bitcoin. ETF demand globally is very strong, and this, coupled with the halving of Bitcoin supply in the market next month, could further lead to a major price hike,\" said WazirX’s Menon.\nBitcoin’s ‘halving’ will reduce the supply of Bitcoin tokens in the market by half, at a time when demand for the token appears to be rising.\nBitcoin’s market cap has surged 74% since 1 January to $1.44 trillion on Thursday, per data from market tracker Coinmarketcap. Daily trading volume in Bitcoin has increased to $47.1 billion per day on Thursday from $18.4 billion on 1 January.\nWith supply set to halve, such metrics are projected to rise even further.\nIndia, however, remains cautious about cryptocurrencies as an asset class. While there is no cryptocurrency law in India yet, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), had banned banks from holding or facilitating trading in cryptocurrency assets in 2018. A Supreme Court order the same year reversed this move, but RBI has maintained a negative stance on cryptocurrencies.\nOn 11 January, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das affirmed that the central bank’s “stance on crypto remains unchanged—travelling down that path will create huge risks\". Further, on 6 September, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman called for establishing a framework to handle “issues related to crypto assets\",identifying cryptocurrencies as “a threat as well as an opportunity\".\nAll of this, coupled with Bitcoin’s steady decline until recently from its previous high of over $69,000 in November 2021 to under $16,000 in November 2022, had seriously affected India’s crypto businesses.\nCoinswitch’s operating revenue declined a staggering 82% to  ₹45.6 crore in FY23 from  ₹248.6 crore in the year prior, as per its annual report filed with the Registrar of Companies on Wednesday. Its net loss, however, reduced to  ₹385.4 crore in FY23 from the previous year’s  ₹513 crore.\nFor CoinDCX, operating revenue tumbled 23% to  ₹456 crore in FY23. However, multiple cost-cutting initiatives, including laying off 12% of its workforce in August, saw the company report a net profit of  ₹28 crore for FY23, attributable to a gross reduction of  ₹201 crore in net expenditure by the unicorn startup.\nSeveral industry stakeholders admit to cost-paring initiatives. “We have made multiple strides towards profitability after slipping into losses in FY22,\" said Coinswitch’s Singhal. “A lot of these moves have included slashing key expenses to run a leaner operation than before. However, much of this will depend on how the market and trading volumes revive.\"\nSinghal added that the company will expand beyond cryptocurrency businesses in the coming months. “We are expanding into other verticals and see major scope for innovation to increase the percentage of population that invest in stocks up to 10-15% from the present 4-6%. Even if our products are not drastically different from existing stock market products, we will look to fill market gaps that currently exist,\" Singhal said.\nSuch diversifications could be more frequent across the cryptocurrency industry, industry stakeholders said, as regulatory conflicts keep investors away.\nBut Indian crypto exchanges may also have to bear some of the blame for not being able to attract more investors, say some industry experts.\n“Exchanges in India have typically charged hefty margins of 8-9% above the price of a token in global exchanges. This does not bode well for investors that are aware of multiple options. In turn, this affects trade volumes further,\" said Sidharth Sogani, founder and chief executive of Crebaco Global.\nThat apart, domestic crypto exchanges haven’t been able to collaborate as an industry to ask for constructive regulations that could have helped India develop cryptocurrency reserves as an asset class, he said.\n“Because of the lack of regulations, crypto ventures and investors, as well as investment-related ventures and funds, have left the country and are plying their trades abroad by operating overseas ventures that do not even cater to Indian users,\" Sogani added.\nSogani’s Crebaco, which offers consultancy and fund management services to crypto investors, is one of several web3 ventures that have moved to the UAE, British Virgin Islands and other locations to cater to global customers. In September, global cryptocurrency platform Coinbase stopped all India operations due to regulatory uncertainties in the country.\nExpansion plans by global crypto firms to launch operations in India, such as that of US blockchain platform Algorand, have not taken off as weak demand and sentiments towards blockchain, cryptocurrencies and the entire web3 ecosystem have kept adoption of niche tech minimal.\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

After an impressive 2023, Bitcoin has maintained momentum in 2024. In just the past month, the world's premier cryptocurrency jumped by more than 40% and notched a new all-time high of more than $73,000.\nNow that Bitcoin is once again in the spotlight, investors may be curious if it's too late to buy. Such concerns are warranted, but with a deeper exploration it becomes clear that there is still considerable upside in the short term and that the long term holds even more promise.\nWith Bitcoin hovering above $67,000 at the time of this writing, it's clear that the huge gains that could have been made when it was trading for just $16,000 during the crypto winter are likely gone. However, that doesn't mean it isn't worthy of an investment today.\nWhen taking a holistic view of Bitcoin's current position relative to past bull markets, there is a plethora of data that shows that we are only in the beginning stages of Bitcoin's resurgence. In other words, Bitcoin has considerable room to run.\nWe can look at metrics derived from its blockchain for proof of this. One of the best indicators of Bitcoin's current position within this cycle is the market value to realized value ratio, or MVRV. Market value is calculated by multiplying Bitcoin's circulating supply by its current price. It is the same as the market capitalization.\nThen there is realized value, which is calculated by determining the price of each Bitcoin the last time it was transacted. This provides a more granular insight into market dynamics as it removes the generalization that every Bitcoin in circulation was purchased at the most recent price.\nBy dividing the two, we get MVRV, and a much better picture of Bitcoin's current position. In fact, MVRV has proven to be a timely indicator of market tops as well as bottoms. Today, Bitcoin's MVRV sits at just over 3, far from the higher levels of 7.5 that usually mark bull market peaks.\nAfter going over the short-term potential for Bitcoin, it's time to zoom out a bit. Arguably the most appealing reason to invest in Bitcoin is its long-term potential.\nTo spare you from reading about my personal conviction and quasi-philosophical belief in Bitcoin, I'll resort to the data to prove why there really is no bad time to buy Bitcoin -- so long as you plan on investing for the long haul.\nIn a recent post on X, Willy Woo, a prominent Bitcoin analyst, highlighted the consistent pattern of Bitcoin's price appreciation over four-year cycles. He demonstrated that holding Bitcoin for at least four years has always resulted in a profit, translating to an average annualized return of about 30%. This showcases Bitcoin's resilience even when it occasionally loses half to three-quarters of its value.\nThe consistent performance of Bitcoin can be attributed to various factors, including its finite supply and the reduction every four years in the rate at which new coins are created. However, what further enhances Bitcoin's appeal over the long term is its ongoing evolution as a legitimate asset.\nA prime example of this evolution is the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs have demonstrated early success, signaling the beginning of Bitcoin's journey toward broader legitimacy. As these ETFs continue to gain traction, the demand for Bitcoin is likely to increase, exerting additional pressure on its limited supply. This trend could potentially lead to a cascading effect.\nAs its distinct functionality and ability to give portfolios a boost becomes more well known, it could kick off widespread adoption of Bitcoin by individuals, corporations, and maybe even governments. From this standpoint, it only reinforces that today remains an opportune moment to grab the world's premier cryptocurrency. It's still early.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Should You Buy It Right Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool","Oops, something went wrong\nFor the first three months of 2024, the primary investment thesis for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been the recent introduction of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). And indeed, with nearly $1 billion flowing into them on a daily basis, these new ETFs have played a prominent role in pushing up the price of the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs.\nBut there's another catalyst on the horizon that could play an equally important role in Bitcoin's future price trajectory: the upcoming halving in mid-April. On one hand, the event could see the crypto rocket even higher, as it has after previous halvings. On the other hand, the event could overpromise and underdeliver, thereby dampening the current Bitcoin euphoria. Let's look at both scenarios.\nIf you examine the track record of Bitcoin, it's hard not to conclude that the upcoming halving will produce some truly spectacular gains. In three previous halving cycles (in 2012, 2016, and 2020), it has skyrocketed to new all-time highs.\nThe classic pattern is for Bitcoin to climb in value ahead of the halving, and then really take off after it. After the last halving in May 2020, when it was still trading for less than $10,000, the digital currency eventually went on to hit a new high of $69,000.\nSo, is history about to repeat itself? Certainly, a lot of investors seem to think so. Many believe Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by the end of this year, and perhaps even soar to $150,000 sometime in 2025.\nIn fact, Grayscale Investments thinks this halving cycle will be the best one ever, thanks to the impact of the new Bitcoin ETFs. There's simply so much new money flooding into Bitcoin right now, that any selling pressure that might occur after the halving will be quickly absorbed by the ETFs.\nAnd indeed, the wealth management team at Morgan Stanley told its clients last October that the time to buy Bitcoin is before the halving, not after. Simply stated, if you wait too long to buy, you'll miss out on all of Bitcoin's expected gains right after the halving takes place.\nThere are two sides to every digital coin, and some Bitcoin skeptics out there think the upcoming halving will overpromise and underdeliver.\nFor one, the crypto might have peaked too early. In three previous halving cycles, it hit a new high after the halving, and not before. But this time around, it's still 30 days out from the halving, and Bitcoin is roaring to all-time highs. Something seems to be, well, different this time around.\nMoreover, there's the big question of whether or not the impact of the halving has already been priced in. After all, we know the moment of the halving, down to the exact hour, minute, and second. So if you buy into the notion that financial markets are generally efficient, then we shouldn't see a major pop after the halving.\nIn fact, JPMorgan Chase has warned that the price of Bitcoin might actually sink as low as $42,000 after the halving, due in part to what the halving event will mean for key members of the crypto's ecosystem.\nBitcoin miners, for example, could see their production costs soar at the same time as their mining rewards are being cut in half. With miners reeling, says JPMorgan Chase, that could inject a lot more selling pressure into the crypto market.\nAt the end of the day, focusing too much on a single date in history -- the halving date -- might be a mistake. From my perspective, the long-term trajectory for Bitcoin is up, and I'm not worried about a potential downswing after the halving. Now that Wall Street has embraced crypto, the influx of new money into the Bitcoin ETFs shows no signs of stopping.\nAs both retail and institutional investors boost their portfolio allocations to Bitcoin, this appears to be a trend with enormous long-term staying power. As a result, I'm enormously bullish on the cryptocurrency's prospects.\nOver the long haul, Bitcoin has the potential to outperform every other asset class, much as it has since 2011. For that reason, I'm buying it before the upcoming halving, and I'm not giving it a second thought.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

A 7% dip in the cryptocurrency’s price led to the fall of other big-name stocks, including Tesla, MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and others. The top cryptocurrency fell from $73,000 to around $63,000 in less than a week. The fall in price comes a day after Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF, GBTC, witnessed record daily outflows of $642.5 million on Monday.\nBitcoin-maxi and software company MicroStrategy suffered a nearly 7.5% loss on Tuesday, trading at $1,384 at the time of writing. Today, the company completed another convertible note offering to increase its Bitcoin holdings as part of its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy. It sold another $604 million of notes to buy 9,000 bitcoin. Former MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor announced on X that the company had completed its previously announced offering of 0.875% convertible senior notes due 2031. As of today, the company holds 214,246 bitcoin, which is 1% of the total Bitcoin supply.\nTesla’s stock price has dropped 60% from its all-time high, currently trading at $171 with a 1.2% decrease in a day. The stock price fluctuated after an interview posted on X in which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was asked about his alleged drug use. His comments came after The Wall Street Journal published a story about his alleged drug intake. The EV company currently holds over 10,500 bitcoin which is worth $336 million, according to data tracked by CoinGecko.\nCoinbase, the biggest publicly traded crypto exchange, declined 3% during the day, trading at $230 at the time of writing. The drop in the price is linked to the sharp decline in the price of Bitcoin.\nOther stocks, such as Square, headed by Jack Dorsey, witnessed a nearly 2% decline, hovering around $80. In the same vein, crypto-friendly company Robinhood’s shares fell 5% to $17, while crypto mining company Riot Platforms suffered an over 2% loss, dropping to $11.\nBitcoin’s sudden price drop may not indicate the start of a bearish trend, and experts believe that it will soon recover and reach new heights.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","In this article\nShares of MicroStrategy tumbled on Tuesday alongside the price of bitcoin, as the company bought even more of the cryptocurrency.\nThe stock was last lower by 5.67%. Earlier, it fell as much as 18%.\nThe move came as MicroStrategy bought an additional 9,245 bitcoins for about $623 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company used $592.3 million in net proceeds from a recent private offering of convertible senior notes and excess cash to make its purchase.\nMicroStrategy made a similar move last week, purchasing 12,000 bitcoins for close to $822 million following a debt sale as bitcoin was climbing to all-time highs. The company now holds a total of 214,246 bitcoins, it announced Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin fell on Tuesday, sliding below $63,000 at one point, about $10,000 below last week's record high.

Both began turning lower last week as investors took profits.","Bitcoin dropped over 7% on Tuesday, which may be its biggest single-day decline in two weeks. On Tuesday (Mar. 19) morning, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $63,000, down from a high of $73,000 earlier this month.\nThe Bitcoin price dropped following a decline in spot ETFs yesterday. The net inflow of Grayscale has decreased significantly in the last few days, while the outflows have reached a record high of over $640 million.\nThe decline spread across the crypto market, with Ether — the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap — falling by over 8% from Monday to Tuesday to trade around $3,200. Ether competitor Solana, which gained popularity earlier this year among the blockchain community, fell over 13% in the same time period and is currently hovering at $180.

And, as those markets mature, and as those funds grow, those fees tend to come down, and we expect the same to be true of GBTC.\"\nGBTC has logged outflows of more than $12 billion since it was converted into an ETF in early January, according to data from crypto investment firm CoinShares, due in no small part to its higher-than-average fees.\nCoinShares' data shows that GBTC recorded its biggest single daily outflow on Monday, with withdrawals totalling $643 million.\n\"Of course, we anticipated having outflows,\" Sonnenshein told CNBC. \"Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation.\"\nMarket commentators argue that the bankruptcy of crypto giant FTX has played a significant role in the selloff of GBTC. FTX was a major holder of GBTC before it filed for insolvency in November 2022, holding about 22 million shares as of Oct. 25.\nThe FTX bankruptcy estate reportedly offloaded the majority of its shares in Grayscale's bitcoin ETF, according to January reporting from Bloomberg and CoinDesk.\n\"None of that came as a surprise, right,\" Sonnenshein said, speaking about the outflows. \"What we've seen is GBTC continue to trade liquidly with tight spreads, and across a very diversified shareholder base. So we kind of think we're between the first and the second inning of this.\"\n\"We're kind of at the end of that first inning now, where the pent-up demand for buying has hopefully been satisfied, the pent up demand for selling has also hopefully been satisfied,\" Sonnenshein added.\n\"And now we're kind of starting to move towards that second and third inning, where there's so much more of the market that still is not yet accessing these products.\"\nThe crypto fund manager charges a 1.5% management fee for GBTC holders, significantly higher than the charge commanded by many ETF providers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\nThis self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts\nLooking for alternatives to Nvidia?

He said that the reason other ETFs have lower fees is that their products \"don't have a track record,\" and the issuers are trying to lure investors with fee incentives.\nSonnenshein said the reason other ETFs have lower fees is that the products \"don't have a track record\" and the issuers are trying to attract investors with fee incentives. \"I think from our standpoint, it may at times call into question their long-term commitment to the asset class,\" he said.\nSonnenshein told CNBC Monday that \"all of these new issuers really came into the market to compete with us\" and are also rivaling each other.\nGrayscale also wants to introduce other ways of giving investors less costly ways of accessing its bitcoin ETF, including a \"mini\" version of its flagship product — the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, announced last week. The new ETF is set to trade under the ticker \"BTC\" and have a materially lower fee than GBTC.\nThe new BTC ETF would be effectively spun out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF and seeded with an as-yet undisclosed portion of bitcoin underlying GBTC shares.\nUnder this structure, existing holders of GBTC would be able to benefit from a lower total blended fee while maintaining the same exposure to bitcoin, spanning ownership of shares of both GBTC and BTC.\nExisting GBTC shareholders would also be able to convert into BTC without paying capital gains tax.\nThe firm is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF.\nMoving forward, Sonnenshein wants investors to turn their attention toward the business' other crypto investment products, which track prices of different cryptocurrencies including ether and solana.\nThe company is trying to have its Grayscale Ethereum Trust converted into an ETF, but is awaiting SEC approval.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to reflect that VanEck waived fees on its bitcoin ETF until March 2025. An earlier version misstated the name of the company.",null,"Bitcoin slumped to its lowest price in weeks Tuesday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s all-time high achieved last week looks to be fleeting.\nBitcoin’s mid-March plunge erased about $180 billion in value.\nBitcoin fell 7% to below $63,000 by 2 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (10 a.m. EDT), the time zone typically used for cryptocurrencies as the digital assets are traded constantly.\nTuesday was bitcoin’s lowest price since March 5.\nBitcoin is now down about 15% from its all-time high of nearly $73,800 set last Thursday.\nOther cryptocurrencies have similarly slumped, and prices of the next three largest digital assets – ether, Solana and Binance coin – are down more than 7% apiece over the last 24 hours.\nThere’s no singular catalyst for the recent bitcoin selloff, but several factors are likely at play. Bitcoin’s price is historically much more volatile than stock prices, which combined with traders’ tendency to take profits following a massive runup in asset prices can cause notable downward swings. There’s also significantly elevated trading activity for bitcoin as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) flooded institutional money into crypto, with daily dollar-value bitcoin volumes registering their 10 largest values over the last three weeks alone, according to Yahoo Finance data. Finally, there’s been a noticeable uptick in liquidations for bitcoin futures contracts, according to Coinglass, which can send bitcoin prices lower as exchanges force users to close their leveraged bitcoin positions.\n$320 billion. That’s about how much the combined market capitalization of the global crypto market is down over the last week, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin’s $180 billion slide accounts for much of the decline.\nBitcoin’s returns remain eye popping, as its roughly 40% gain over the last six months and 130% year-to-date far outpace those of leading stock indexes. The rally, which erased the steep decline suffered by bitcoin in 2022 as the crypto industry turned sideways amid higher borrowing costs and revelations of high-profile bad actors like FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, came as equity prices rose and investors grew excited about the prospects of the ETFs, which went live in January, attracting billions of dollars of fresh capital.\nOne Community.

Still not sure how the former CEO of the software intelligence company feels about the world's largest cryptocurrency?\nMaybe this will help.\n\"Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple and secure savings account to billions of people that don't have the option or desire to run their own hedge fund,\" Saylor said.\nOkay, so the guy really likes bitcoin. And on March 19, the first day of spring, MicroStrategy took a bigger bite out of bitcoin when the company said it had bought 9,245 bitcoins for $623 million between March 11 and March 18.\nMicroStrategy said it a completed a $603.75 million convertible debt offering — its second in a week — to raise money to buy bitcoin.\nThe company now holds about $13.5 billion of bitcoin, which adds up to more than 1% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, according to CoinDesk.\nshutterstock\nMicroStrategy said in a regulatory filing that it had paid roughly $7.53 billion for its bitcoin stash, an average of $35,160 per coin.\nThe company's stock fell on Tuesday, while bitcoin posted its biggest single-day loss since November 2022. MicroStrategy was off slightly to $1,416 at last check on Wednesday and bitcoin was up 2.3% to $63.607.\nRelated: Analyst unveils Nvidia stock price 'line in the sand'\nPhong Le, MicroStrategy’s president and CEO, told analysts during the company’s Feb. 6 fourth-quarter-earnings call that \"we remain highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus..\"\n\"We consider MicroStrategy to be the world's first bitcoin development company,\" he said. \"We are a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the bitcoin network through activities in the financial markets, advocacy, and technology innovation.\"\nMicroStrategy earned $4.96 a share in the quarter, beating the FactSet consensus of a loss of 64 cents, and light years beyond the year-ago loss of $21.93 a share.\nRevenue totaled $124.5 million, compared with FactSet's call for $133 million and the year-earlier tally of $132.6 million.\nDuring the call, Saylor told analysts that \"2024 is the year of birth of bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset class.\"\nMicroStrategy, he said, completed the first 15 years of the bitcoin life cycle, back when it was largely unregulated and misunderstood.\n\"The next 15 years, I would expect, will be a regulated, institutional, high-growth period of bitcoin, very, very different in many ways from the last 15 years,\" Saylor said.\n\"Bitcoin itself is performing well for a number of reasons, but one reason is because it represents the digital transformation of capital,\" he added.\nOf course, life with bitcoin wasn't always sunshine and roses.\nMore Wall Street Analysts:\nAnalyst unveils Nvidia stock price 'line in the sand'\nAnalyst revamps homebuilder stock price target before Fed rate call\nAnalysts revamp Nvidia price targets as Blackwell tightens AI market grip\nWe take you back now to those less-than-thrilling days yesteryear, when covid-19 was on the rampage and the price of bitcoin fell 30% from March 8 to March 12 2020.\nBy the end of 2021, bitcoin had fallen nearly 30%.

This comes at an excellent time for Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), a Bitcoin infrastructure innovator that has spent the past month trending downward. Other companies in the space, such as Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA), have struggled recently as well. But now, as the year’s biggest crypto event draws near, bullish sentiment toward RIOT stock is shifting. And one investment bank is highly optimistic about Riot’s growth prospects, as evidenced by its recent price target and forecast.\nJPMorgan Chase isn’t the only Wall Street institution to issue a bullish prediction for RIOT stock. But it recently issued a $15 price target, indicating an upside potential of almost 30%. This news has sent shares up 7% today, and the stock’s current trajectory suggests it has even more room to run. Additionally, JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith upgraded RIOT to an “overweight” rating, up from “neutral.” As Investing.com reports:\n“The adjustment comes as Riot Platforms is expected to significantly increase its hashrate, a key performance metric in the cryptocurrency mining industry. The company is on track to boost its hashrate by 9 EH\/s in the coming months, with an additional 10 EH\/s expected in the second half of 2024. This expansion could elevate the firm’s total hashrate to an impressive 31.5 EH\/s by the end of the year.”\nThese aren’t the only reasons investors are optimistic about Riot’s growth prospects. InvestorPlace contributor Stavros Tousios notes that the company has the lowest production cost in its industry, which could set it up for even further growth as the crypto boom continues to take shape.\nAs noted, Smith is only the most recent expert to issue a bullish price target for RIOT stock. It currently boasts a strong buy consensus, with eight out of eight analysts rating it as a buy. Recent upgrades include Needham, Bernstein and B.Riley Financial, all of whom see significant upside potential. This trend is likely to continue as momentum for the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 continues to drive the crypto rally, pushing RIOT stock and its peers up in the process.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

And that’s very bad news for crypto enthusiasts who were hopeful that spot Ether ETFs, which would make it easier for investors to invest in the cryptocurrency without holding it personally, would be approved by regulators soon.\nThe news comes after CoinDesk first noticed on Wednesday that the Ethereum Foundation had recently included a note on Github about being investigated by an unnamed “state authority.” The spokesperson for the SEC told Gizmodo via email on Wednesday that, “The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.”\nThe purpose of the SEC’s apparent investigation, according to people who spoke with Fortune, is to classify Ethereum as a security. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has previously said Bitcoin isn’t a security but should be classified as a commodity while suggesting practically all other crypto coins are securities.\nFrom Fortune:\nAccording to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena  request, the SEC’s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began  shortly after the blockchain’s shift to a new governance model known as “proof-of-stake” in September of 2022.\nThat proof-of-stake event moved the blockchain away from the  energy-intensive model used by Bitcoin in favor of one that relies on a  trusted network of validators—and provided the SEC with a new pretext to  attempt to define Ethereum as a security, according to people at three  different companies familiar with the subpoenas. The people asked Fortune  not identify to identify them or their firms for fear of retaliation by  the agency’s chair, Gary Gensler, who one described as “vindictive.”\nWhy does it matter if Ethereum is a security? That means Ethereum and the exchanges that trade it will be subject to tighter enforcement from the SEC.\nEthereum’s price has ticked down roughly 14% over the past five days though it’s still up 98% in the past six months. The crypto coin was trading at roughly $1,600 in late September.\nEthereum was created in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin after he rather famously became frustrated that his favorite World of Warcraft character’s capabilities were degraded. To Buterin, that was when he “realized what horrors centralized services can bring,” leading him to create an ostensibly decentralized crypto coin.\nButerin is estimated to be worth about $400 million, according to Forbes, down from about $1.4 billion in 2021.\nCryptocurrenciesEthereumForbesGary GenslerGithub\nWorld will distribute money to developers who build \"mini apps\" that require users verify their humanness.\nWorld Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\nThe cryptocurrency \"mixer\" Tornado Cash is no longer blacklisted.\nSurely this is all on the level.\nJoe Lonsdale, who supports both Trump and crypto, smells a scam.\nTime?

But lately, one less-mainstream blockchain is perhaps making the biggest waves in crypto: Solana. TechCrunch has reported on Solana’s massive, recent price appreciation, digging into its rapid ascent and the reasons why.\nThat’s what we talked about on today’s TechCrunch Minute. The answer is not something new, but instead a return of something that we’ve seen in the past. To avoid spoiling the fun, I’ll just say that it involves Dogwifhat and Bonk. Those were fun words to say to camera!\nOf course, there’s no harm in fun and price pumps are popular. But without a new central innovation, it’s probably fair to worry that the current crypto summer has less substance to it than prior booms that we’ve seen built atop something new, or at least newly popular.

Bitcoin has climbed 44% year-to-date. On Friday, it hovered at around $63,768.\n\"Last year we put out our bull case for bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.\"\nArk was one of 11 firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, that got approval from the SEC for spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Since those products hit the market, demand has boomed, notching all-time records for inflows into US ETFs while also stimulating demand for the crypto itself, which the funds invest in directly and hold.\nIndustry veterans also forecast that the bitcoin halving event, which is expected to happen in April, could create a supply shock, which would further catalyze the current demand-fueled rally.\nWood said at the conference, hosted by Reflexivity Research, that she expects the upcoming halving to have a similar effect as the prior events. In the 12 months following the three halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, the price of bitcoin climbed 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\"We think [bitcoin] has miles to go,\" Wood maintained. \"We're at the very beginning of really putting in place the financial ecosystem native to the internet and disintermediating all of the toll-takers.\"\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nCheck out Business Insider's picks for  best cryptocurrency exchanges\nGet the latest Gold price here.","Billionaire Mike Novogratz expects bitcoin to keep climbing due to a lack of fiscal discipline from the US government.\nIn a Friday interview at Reflexivity Research's Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, the Galaxy Digital CEO told moderator Anthony Pompliano that irresponsible leadership and reckless spending could be a long-term boon for the world's biggest cryptocurrency.\n\"What's the macro story for bitcoin?\" Novogratz said. \"It's relatively simple. Our government can't keep its pants on and stop spending money. That went from a problem in the early 2000s to a crisis with Donald Trump and Joe Biden. They go down as the two presidents who destroyed our fiscal stability.\"\nCommentators have warned the high government spending is a threat as it ramps up the already rapid pace of borrowing and could further stoke inflation. Warnings over excessive government borrowing have been building as the national debt topped $34 trillion this year. Bank of America earlier this month noted that bitcoin investment was on the rise as a \"debt debasement\" trade as the US adds $1 trillion to the national debt every 100 days.\nNovogratz — who said he first became interested in bitcoin when it was under $100 per token over a decade ago — explained that President Trump raised spending ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThat escalated once the pandemic began, then increased further when President Biden took office and pushed a number of new spending packages, the Galaxy chief said.

Steve is methodical (reflects his engineering background), numbers- and strategy-oriented, and OK with not being a celebrity executive. Having said that, he is the same guy who battled hard to keep the Apple (AAPL) chip business and laid the groundwork for Qualcomm in 5G and the connected automobile. So Boeing isn't getting an operational slouch by any stretch of the imagination.\nIt will be fascinating to see the CEO search process Steve and the Boeing board run.\nWall Street has a new high-water mark for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nOppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus now sees the benchmark index ending the year at 5,500, reflecting a roughly 5% increase from Friday's close. The call comes after a surge in stocks pushed the benchmark index past his initial target of 5,200 less than three months into the year.\nStoltzfus entered the year looking for one or two interest rate cuts, and to him, little has changed in that storyline since December as the Federal Reserve recently projected three interest rate cuts this year with a bias leaning toward the possibility of two cuts. He noted positive signs in earnings over the last several quarters, resilience in US economic growth, and a \"capitulation\" among the bearish community all support his upgrade to the S&P 500's performance.\n\"All of the above prompts us to increase our year-end price target acknowledging the possibility that we might need to raise the target price again later this year should this economic and market outlook prove us too conservative in our projections,\" Stoltzfus wrote.\nOther analysts have recently raised their targets for the benchmark index. Earlier this month, Bank of America predicted the S&P would end the year at 5,400, matching a previous call from UBS.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) both fell on Monday morning after the Financial Times reported China would phase out the use of their chips and servers in government computers.\nShares of Intel declined more than 3%, dragging on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which fell 0.3%.\nAMD stock dipped as much as 2% before paring back some of those losses during the first hour of trading.\nShares of rivals ARM (ARM) and Micron (MU) gained more than 5% on Monday morning.\nFisker (FSR) shares were halted for trading on news pending shortly after the market opened on Monday morning.\nShares were down 28% after the electric vehicle startup said its talks with a large automaker for a potential transaction had ended. Fisker did not reveal the automaker's name.

The industrial giant is in the middle of a safety crisis that began in early January after a panel blew off a 737 MAX 9 plane during an Alaska Air flight.\nFoot Locker (FL) has had a brutal 12 months.\nWeak sales. Weak margins. Rough outlooks. The reasons for all of this are varied, from changing sneaker preferences (think more demand for chunky dad shoes as opposed to athletic sneakers) to Nike (NKE) execution issues to Foot Locker's own operational challenges.\nAll in, the stock is down 36% in the past year — and it's deserved (just take a look at the company's latest earnings presentation for support).\nDespite this, Evercore ISI's Michael Binetti is tossing a dart at the stock rebounding. He upgraded his rating to Outperform this morning, citing:\nAppreciate the analysis, but FL remains a show-me story.\nI still remember meeting Brian Niccol in 2016.\nAt the time, he was the CEO of Yum! Brands (YUM) owned Taco Bell. I was in my early 30s still trying to figure out a reporter role and also looking for ways to save money (in part because I wasn't making much in said role!) — that included eating dinner at Taco Bell.\nI met Brian in a hotel conference room after he presented at an investor day. Despite being a young guy with a ton of success on his resume, I found Brian to be humble and insanely knowledgeable about the fast-food industry. I came away thinking Brian would be a game-changer as CEO of a stand-alone business.\nEight years later, Brian is still the same guy I met despite even more success on his resume as CEO of Chipotle (CMG). Here is my new exclusive chat with Brian now on Yahoo Finance. We touched on a lot in our 25-minute phone chat, but my main takeaway is that Chipotle shareholders remain in a good place because someone like Brian is at the helm backed up by the equally impressive CFO in Jack Hartung.\nA couple of takeaways from the interview:\nAs we enter the final week of trading in a relatively hot March for various asset classes, investors remain on bubble watch.\nA new survey from Deutsche Bank that dropped this morning still shows investors perhaps worried about how fast bitcoin and tech stocks have come on.\nMakes sense as tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) has surged 19% this month on AI hype and bitcoin is up by 9%!","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWall Street's furious 2024 rally took a breather to start the final week of the year's first quarter.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.3% Monday, while the the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped 0.4%.

Steve is methodical (reflects his engineering background), numbers- and strategy-oriented, and OK with not being a celebrity executive. Having said that, he is the same guy who battled hard to keep the Apple (AAPL) chip business and laid the groundwork for Qualcomm in 5G and the connected automobile. So Boeing isn't getting an operational slouch by any stretch of the imagination.\nIt will be fascinating to see the CEO search process Steve and the Boeing board run.\nWall Street has a new high-water mark for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nOppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus now sees the benchmark index ending the year at 5,500, reflecting a roughly 5% increase from Friday's close. The call comes after a surge in stocks pushed the benchmark index past his initial target of 5,200 less than three months into the year.\nStoltzfus entered the year looking for one or two interest rate cuts, and to him, little has changed in that storyline since December as the Federal Reserve recently projected three interest rate cuts this year with a bias leaning toward the possibility of two cuts. He noted positive signs in earnings over the last several quarters, resilience in US economic growth, and a \"capitulation\" among the bearish community all support his upgrade to the S&P 500's performance.\n\"All of the above prompts us to increase our year-end price target acknowledging the possibility that we might need to raise the target price again later this year should this economic and market outlook prove us too conservative in our projections,\" Stoltzfus wrote.\nOther analysts have recently raised their targets for the benchmark index. Earlier this month, Bank of America predicted the S&P would end the year at 5,400, matching a previous call from UBS.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) both fell on Monday morning after the Financial Times reported China would phase out the use of their chips and servers in government computers.\nShares of Intel declined more than 3%, dragging on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which fell 0.3%.\nAMD stock dipped as much as 2% before paring back some of those losses during the first hour of trading.\nShares of rivals ARM (ARM) and Micron (MU) gained more than 5% on Monday morning.\nFisker (FSR) shares were halted for trading on news pending shortly after the market opened on Monday morning.\nShares were down 28% after the electric vehicle startup said its talks with a large automaker for a potential transaction had ended. Fisker did not reveal the automaker's name. Earlier this month Reuters reported Nissan was in talks to invest in the cash-strapped startup.\nIn mid-March shares tanked more than 50% on a Wall Street Journal report that the company could be reporting for bankruptcy soon.\nThe stock is down 98% year to date, at $0.09 per share.\nStocks opened lower on Monday to start out the last week of the month and quarter. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.3% while the the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) declined 0.6%, led by a slide in technology stocks.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2%, dragged by shares of Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL).\nBoeing (BA) shares rose more than 3% after the plane manufacturer announced CEO Dave Calhoun will step down at the end of the year. The industrial giant is in the middle of a safety crisis that began in early January after a panel blew off a 737 MAX 9 plane during an Alaska Air flight.\nFoot Locker (FL) has had a brutal 12 months.\nWeak sales. Weak margins. Rough outlooks. The reasons for all of this are varied, from changing sneaker preferences (think more demand for chunky dad shoes as opposed to athletic sneakers) to Nike (NKE) execution issues to Foot Locker's own operational challenges.\nAll in, the stock is down 36% in the past year — and it's deserved (just take a look at the company's latest earnings presentation for support).\nDespite this, Evercore ISI's Michael Binetti is tossing a dart at the stock rebounding. He upgraded his rating to Outperform this morning, citing:\nAppreciate the analysis, but FL remains a show-me story.\nI still remember meeting Brian Niccol in 2016.\nAt the time, he was the CEO of Yum! Brands (YUM) owned Taco Bell. I was in my early 30s still trying to figure out a reporter role and also looking for ways to save money (in part because I wasn't making much in said role!) — that included eating dinner at Taco Bell.\nI met Brian in a hotel conference room after he presented at an investor day. Despite being a young guy with a ton of success on his resume, I found Brian to be humble and insanely knowledgeable about the fast-food industry. I came away thinking Brian would be a game-changer as CEO of a stand-alone business.\nEight years later, Brian is still the same guy I met despite even more success on his resume as CEO of Chipotle (CMG). Here is my new exclusive chat with Brian now on Yahoo Finance. We touched on a lot in our 25-minute phone chat, but my main takeaway is that Chipotle shareholders remain in a good place because someone like Brian is at the helm backed up by the equally impressive CFO in Jack Hartung.\nA couple of takeaways from the interview:\nAs we enter the final week of trading in a relatively hot March for various asset classes, investors remain on bubble watch.\nA new survey from Deutsche Bank that dropped this morning still shows investors perhaps worried about how fast bitcoin and tech stocks have come on.\nMakes sense as tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) has surged 19% this month on AI hype and bitcoin is up by 9%!",null,"25th Mar, 2024. 04:51 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nBTC TO USD – Today’s Bitcoin price in Dollar on Jan 24, 2024\nAs of March 25, the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate stands at $66825.01.

Bitcoin’s value in dollars reflects the dynamic nature"],"article_contents":["The upcoming sentencing hearing for Sam Bankman-Fried, set for March 28, could be influenced by a “remarkable surge” in the value of Bitcoin, the Financial Times has reported. Scheduled to take place in the Southern District of New York before Judge Lewis Kaplan, the hearing could potentially be influenced by recent developments surrounding the cryptocurrency.\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have seized upon the skyrocketing prices of various cryptocurrencies and AI assets held by FTX, arguing that this development could mitigate the financial harm caused by their client's actions. They have made a bold claim, stating: “Each victim... will receive 100 cents on the dollar, plus interest.”\nThe defence team has argued for a lenient sentence for Bankman-Fried citing the recovery efforts in the aftermath of FTX's collapse. They assert that victims will eventually be fully compensated, highlighting the recent surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, the FT report said.\nBankman-Fried's lawyers contend that the $8 billion shortfall in FTX's balance sheet was merely a temporary setback caused by unprecedented customer withdrawal requests during a rush on FTX in late 2022. They emphasize that victims will receive 100 cents on the dollar, plus interest, bolstered by the increased value of cryptocurrency assets, the report added.\n“The harm to customers, lenders, and investors is zero,” Bankman-Fried's lawyers wrote to Kaplan last month, arguing for a sentence of no longer than six-and-a-half years. The $8bn hole, they said, reflected “the temporary shortfall in liquid assets to cover the unprecedented level of customer withdrawal requests” during a rush on FTX in late 2022.\nIn stark contrast, John Ray, the caretaker CEO of FTX overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings, offered a more tempered view. Ray underscored the complexity of victim restitution and the enduring challenges in achieving full economic recovery for all affected parties. Ray contends that even the best-case scenario will not result in a complete restoration of victims' economic positions prior to the fraud.\n“Mr Bankman-Fried’s victims will never be returned to the same economic position they would have been in today absent his colossal fraud,” Ray told Kaplan in a letter this month, as quoted by FT. “Indeed, even the best conceivable outcome . . . will not yield a true, full economic recovery by all creditors and non-insider equity investors as if the fraud never happened.”\nThe disparity between Bankman-Fried's lawyers' optimistic claims and Ray's cautious assessment raised questions about the potential influence of Bitcoin price fluctuations on the sentencing decision. While Bankman-Fried's defence team seeks to downplay the severity of the crimes and advocate for a shorter sentence, Ray's statements underscored the lasting impact and ongoing uncertainties surrounding victim restitution.\nProsecutors, who have urged the court to impose a sentence of 40 to 50 years, have dismissed Bankman-Fried's claims as a \"distorted depiction\" of the bankruptcy proceedings. They maintain that many customers may never recover the full value of their investments, and the emotional toll on victims cannot be undone by potential recoveries.\nProsecutors argued that Bankman-Fried's victims \"have received no recovery and there is no timeline for when any such payments will be made.\"\n“The fact that two years later victims may receive some money back through FTX’s bankruptcy is of little comfort for those victims who needed the money in November 2022,” prosecutors wrote, as quoted by FT. “The suffocating sense of dread and despair that victims felt when they could not withdraw their money, their shame and embarrassment, and the resulting damage to lives and businesses, cannot be undone through the bankruptcy.”\nCatch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

The agency also demanded the company be \"permanently restrained and enjoined\" from continuing to do so.\nIn her ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla wrote, \"The 'crypto' nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.\"\n\"The Court finds that the SEC adequately alleges that Coinbase, through its Staking Program, engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,\" Failla wrote.\nThe judge elsewhere in that ruling agreed to dismiss the SEC's claim in the lawsuit that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker by making its Wallet application available to customers.\nThe company responded to CNBC's request for comment with a link to a series of posts on social media platform X by Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal.\n\"We were prepared for this, and we look forward to uncovering more about the SEC's internal views and discussions on crypto regulation,\" Grewal wrote.\nThe SEC later Wednesday filed a notice of Failla's decision in the Coinbase case on the docket of a lawsuit it has pending in federal court in the District of Columbia against Binance, another major cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC in that suit accuses Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities.\nWednesday's decision news comes as Coinbase takes on a bigger role in Wall Street's adoption of cryptocurrency.\nIn January, the SEC approved a raft of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Many of these ETFs have partnered with Coinbase as their custody partner.\nThese U.S. spot funds have seen record flows since launching in January. Collectively, they have brought in around $52 billion.\nIn June, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on CNBC that trading platforms like Coinbase \"call themselves exchanges\" but were \"commingling a number of functions.\"\n\"We don't see the New York Stock Exchange operating a hedge fund,\" Gensler said at the time.","27th Mar, 2024. 12:42 pm\nShare\nListen\nFont size\nDark Mode\nSave\nPrint\nKarachi: The rate of Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) will Bitcoin (BTC) in Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is Rs 19478765.74 on March 27, 2024.\n1 BTC = 19478765.74 Pakistani rupees.\nDisclaimer: All data and information are provided for informational purposes only.

And it's not a trivial risk at all.\" The judge added that it was \"for the purpose of disabling him to the extent that can appropriately be done for a significant period of time.\"\nDamian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that the sentence sends \"an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe.\"\nAttorneys for Bankman-Fried argued that their client never intended to defraud customers, and that Judge Kaplan should therefore show leniency.\n\"Sam was not a ruthless financial serial killer who set out every morning to hurt people,\" defense lawyer Marc Mukasey said, Reuters reported. Mukasey described his client as an \"awkward math nerd\" who tried to return customers' money to them after FTX collapsed, according to the report.\nAlthough Bankman-Fried is expected to appeal his conviction, former federal prosecutor Andrey Spektor said there's little chance that the verdict would be reversed. \"There is nothing anyone can do about that,\" Spektor said, adding that while Bankman-Fried could have received an even lengthier sentence, \"I don't think SBF and his family are celebrating a 25-year term.\"\nSome legal experts thought Bankman-Fried's education and professional connections would bring a measure of leniency, while others expected a harsher sentence.\n\"I suppose I was somewhat in the middle. I realized right away that this time — and this crime — was different, that the judge was actually going to hold him accountable for his actions,\" said sAnat Alon-Beck, business law professor at Case Western Reserve University.\nAlon-Beck compared Bankman-Fried's sentence to that of disgraced Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, who is serving a term of 11.5 years in prison for defrauding investors. \"In SBF's case, the sentence was more than double,\" Alon-Beck said.\nAt the sentencing hearing, Bankman-Fried apologized to his former FTX colleagues, Reuters reported. \"They put a lot of themselves into it, and I threw that all away. It haunts me everyday,\" Bankman-Fried told the judge, adding, \"I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about what happened at every stage. Things I should have done and said, things I shouldn't have.\"\nBankman-Fried's conviction last fall followed the startling 2022 collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency trading platform he had co-founded and led as CEO, amid an $8 billion shortfall in funds. At trial, he was accused of using depositor money to prop up his struggling hedge fund, as well as of using the funds buy luxury properties in the Caribbean and to make donations to a range of causes.\nFTX was once the second-largest crypto exchange in the world, allowing users to buy and sell dozens of virtual currencies, while Bankman-Fried's wealth was estimated at more than $30 billion. Flush with billions of dollars of investors' cash, Bankman-Fried took out a Super Bowl advertisement to promote FTX and bought the naming rights to an arena used by the NBA's Miami Heat.\nBut the collapse of cryptocurrency prices in 2022 crippled FTX and ultimately led to its crash. FTX's hedge fund affiliate, Alameda Research, had made billions of dollars in crypto investments that plunged in value. Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried tried to shore up Alameda's balance sheet with FTX customer funds.\nThree former FTX associates testified against Bankman-Fried after pleading guilty to related crimes. They included Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried's former romantic partner, who alleged that he had pressured her to commit fraud.\n—The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics. She regularly appears on CBS News 24\/7 to discuss her reporting.","Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research, was sentenced to 25 years in prison by Southern District of New York (SDNY) Judge Lewis Kaplan, about five months after he was found guilty on all seven counts related to fraud and money laundering during his trial.\n“When not lying, he was evasive, hair splitting, trying to get the prosecutors to rephrase questions for him,” Kaplan said on Thursday, according to Inner City Press. “I’ve been doing this job for close to 30 years. I’ve never seen a performance like that.”\nBefore sentencing, Bankman-Fried acknowledged in court that he made a “series of bad decisions,” but argued they were not “selfish” ones.\nHis possible total sentence for the seven counts — two fraud charges and five conspiracy charges — was a maximum of 110 years. Bankman-Fried was also ordered during the sentencing to pay forfeiture of $11 billion to the U.S. government. Kaplan said that the “punishment,” or sentencing, was to fit the seriousness of the crime.\nEarlier this month, U.S. prosecutors from the Department of Justice called for a “necessary” 40- to 50-year sentence for him. “The sheer scale of Bankman-Fried’s fraud calls for severe punishment,” the notice stated. “The amount of loss—at least $10 billion—makes this one of the largest financial frauds of all time.” On Thursday, Kaplan said that range “would be more than necessary.” In late February, Bankman-Fried’s attorneys filed a notice suggesting their client gets 63 to 78 months, citing his “caring for individuals,” “remorse,” “low-level culpability” and more.\nRegardless of what both parties wanted, this decades-long sentencing is a result of Bankman-Fried’s five-week trial, which dove deep into how one of the once-biggest crypto exchanges globally, and its sister trading company, collapsed in November 2022.\nHis sentence could also send a signal to the crypto industry at large. As Judge Kaplan is required to consider the “need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence,” aka to discourage other white-collar defendants and for bad actors in the crypto space more generally, Josh Naftalis, a former federal prosecutor now with Pallas Partners in New York, told TechCrunch. “In other words, the court is permitted to consider how the sentence it imposes on SBF will send a message to the crypto asset industry.”\nMark Bini, who’s also a former federal and state prosecutor and now a partner at Reed Smith’s On Chain digital asset group, agrees. The sentence will be a “real marker in the crypto arena,” he said, adding that this outcome “may be a measuring stick for future sentencings involving crypto fraud.”\nAnd in the federal system, there’s no parole. But, defendants like Bankman-Fried can earn “good time” credit, under the First Step Act, which could reduce their sentence for good behavior while incarcerated, both lawyers noted. There’s a number of opportunities for first-time non-violent offenders to earn reductions in their sentences, Bini said. This can result in a defendant’s sentence being reduced by up to 15% of the initial sentence imposed,” Naftalis added.\nBankman-Fried has been residing in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, ever since he lost his bail prior to his trial. Other notorious past inmates of the correctional facility include Jeffery Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli.\nBefore prison, Bankman-Fried was once on top of the crypto world, hanging with celebrities like Katy Perry and trophy-winning athletes like Tom Brady and putting his company name on Major League Baseball umpires’ shirts and the Miami Heat arena. Prior to its collapse, FTX was one of the top crypto exchanges by volume, behind Coinbase and Binance.\nFTX grew its users into the “millions” before its collapse, and revenue expanded from $10 million to $20 million in 2019, to $80 million in 2020 and to $1 billion in 2021; and daily revenue in 2021 was $3 million, Bankman-Fried said during his testimony.\nBut Bankman-Fried quickly dwindled in popularity and trust across the crypto community after a faulty balance sheet from Alameda was unveiled by crypto media publication CoinDesk in November 2022, causing industry-wide ripple effects and concern around FTX and its liquidity. Within days, the exchange filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role as CEO.\nHis trial, and the months leading up to it, uncovered that the problem was much larger than originally thought as Bankman-Fried and other executives misused over $8 billion in customer funds. Bankman-Fried testified that he didn’t defraud FTX customers or use their funds, but that Alameda “borrowed” that capital from the exchange.\nMark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney, also said the government made a Hallmark movie–like case against Bankman-Fried and while he made “bad business judgments” the government has “tried to paint Sam into some sort of villain, some sort of monster.”\nIn the end, the jury didn’t buy that narrative. Prosecutors strongly argued Bankman-Fried made a number of false promises internally and externally and was responsible for the loss of billions of dollars for thousands of FTX investors. They emphasized how it was wrong to use FTX customers’ funds without their knowledge or approval.\nAnd as a result, Bankman-Fried will be spending quite some time behind bars.\nThe article has been updated to include additional details in the third and forth paragraphs.\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Crypto\nJacquelyn Melinek was a reporter at TechCrunch covering cryptocurrency.\nOpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3B, with news expected later this week\nOpenAI debuts Codex CLI, an open source coding tool for terminals\nMicrosoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\nDeck raises $12M to ‘Plaid-ify’ any website using AI\nSubaru debuts Trailseeker, an all-electric SUV coming for Rivian’s outdoorsy EV customer base\nFor security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\nNotorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nKerrisdale Capital is short MicroStrategy stock and long bitcoin.\nThe stock’s relative attractiveness doesn't justify paying more than double for the same coin, Kerrisdale said.\nMicroStrategy is no longer a unique way to gain access to bitcoin, it said.\nMicroStrategy's (MSTR) shares fell as much as 14% on Thursday after a prominent short seller, Kerrisdale Capital, said in a report that it is short-selling the stock while betting long on bitcoin {{BTC}}.\n“Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin, but as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,” the short seller wrote.\nNone of the reasons cited for the stock’s relative attractiveness “justify paying well over double for the same coin,” the report said.\nSoftware developer MicroStrategy’s business model is based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin, and its crypto stash represents the majority of the company’s valuation.

This comes as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovers near an all-time high. One might wonder why this is. After all, the MARA stock price is directly tied to the value of Bitcoin.\nInvestors are factoring in the upcoming Bitcoin halving and its impact on prices. A 50% decrease in revenue is significant for a company like Marathon Digital unless Bitcoin keeps rising. For Bitcoin believers, MARA stock may be a buy.\nIn its recent quarter earnings report, Marathon certainly took a victory lap given its outstanding results.\nThe company brought in more than $150 in net income alongside revenue of $156 million, with 15,126 Bitcoin held on its balance sheet at the end of the year.\nThose Bitcoin alone are worth well over $1 billion at the time of writing, supporting Marathon Digital’s $6 billion valuation.\nHowever, it’s the other $5 billion in the company’s valuation tied to future cash flows that remains uncertain, particularly if the upcoming halving event cut these numbers in half.\nMarathon Digital did announce in its earnings report a plan to boost margins and double its has rate by 2025. This strategic plan may require utilizing some of the company’s Bitcoin reserve, but would also mean the company won’t need to dilute shareholders or take on debt.\nSo, the question around this company’s future financial picture is: where do you see the price of Bitcoin in five years from now?\nAs a major Bitcoin miner, Marathon unveiled MARAFW and MARA UCB 2100, advanced firmware and control boards enhancing Bitcoin mining rigs’ performance and efficiency.\nAfter a year of development and testing, Marathon is implementing MARAFW across its 200,000+ mining rigs.\nAfter successful initial rollouts, Marathon extends MARAFW and MARA UCB 2100 to the wider Bitcoin mining community. The firm has sold these to multiple enterprise clients and now offers them to all interested miners.\nMARAFW, a customized firmware, optimizes Bitcoin miners’ chip settings for enhanced performance, efficiency, and stability.\nIt features hash rate optimization, auto-tuning, overclocking, underclocking, and intelligent thermal protection. MARAFW is compatible with most stock control boards and Marathon’s MARA UCB 2100.\nThese enhancements are certainly worth noting, and there’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening behind the scenes the market doesn’t appear to be factoring in right now.\nMarathon Digital’s path forward remains murky. There’s plenty of short interest around this stock, with so much uncertainty tied to the company’s future cash flow generation capabilities.\nThat said, considering the balance of risks, I think MARA stock looks like a buy at current levels, for those who think Bitcoin will continue to push past $100,000 per token by the end of the year.\nIt’s my view that MARA stock could actually be a better way to play Bitcoin’s potential rise than Bitcoin itself. Its leveraged nature essentially ensures this.\nOf course, it’s a risky bet. But those in the crypto sector aren’t scared of risk, especially considering the momentum in this space right now.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\nThe post Why MARA Is the Top Crypto Stock to Buy to Play Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Rise appeared first on InvestorPlace.","Investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin should buy a spot bitcoin ETF rather than betting on MicroStrategy stock, according to a short report from Kerrisdale Capital.\nThe investment firm said it was shorting MicroStrategy stock and buying bitcoin as an arbitrage trade to capitalize on the \"unjustifiable premium\" valuation that MicroStrategy trades at relative to bitcoin.\nAccording to Kerrisdale Capital's calculations, MicroStrategy trades at a valuation of $177,000 per bitcoin it owns.\n\"Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,\" Kerrisdale Capital said. \"The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over.\"\nMicroStrategy has gone on a bitcoin buying spree over the past few years.\nLed by its co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has amassed 214,246 bitcoin, or more than 1% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency, at an average cost of $35,160 per coin.\nAt bitcoin's current price of $70,814, MicroStrategy's crypto holdings are worth $15.2 billion. But the company has an enterprise value of $38 billion, or more than double the value of its bitcoin holdings.\nAnd that's where the disconnect is, according to Kerrisdale Capital, which ascribes just a $1.3 billion value to MicroStrategy's underlying software business.\n\"In effect, MicroStrategy shareholders are now paying $177k per bitcoin when they could instead gain exposure to the asset through any of a growing number of ETPs, brokerages, payment platforms, and exchanges for less than half that,\" Kerrisdale Capital said.\nWith bitcoin now readily available to nearly all investors via spot bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy's allure as an easy way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without opening an account at a cryptocurrency exchange is likely to fade.\n\"IBIT, FBTC, and a raft of other vehicles offer liquidity and ease of trading that will only grow in number globally.

It also served as a crash pad for his inner circle, including FTX bigwigs Zixiao “Gary” Wang and Nishad Singh — alongside Caroline Ellison, his on-again, off-again flame, who steered the affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research.\nAll three, implicated in the FTX scandal, copped pleas and spilled the beans on Bankman-Fried during his high-profile trial.\nDesigned by Morris Adjmi Architects, this penthouse was once listed for a staggering $40 million after the FTX bankruptcy bombshell in November 2022.\nHowever, any hopes of a quick sale were dashed as FTX bankruptcy honchos swiftly moved to safeguard the company’s assets amid court-ordered liquidation proceedings.\nNow, under FTX’s firm grip, this sumptuous penthouse is poised to hit the market in the coming weeks, as revealed in recent court filings.\nCourt records reveal that FTX is also gearing up to offload a slew of prime real estate assets in the exclusive Albany resort community, with a total value of $151 million.\nAside from the iconic Orchid penthouse, prospective buyers can vie for a slice of paradise in 15 other properties within Albany.\nThese include multiple condos spread across prestigious buildings like Charles, Choral, Cube and Gemini, offering a taste of luxury living at its finest.\nBut FTX’s real estate fire sale doesn’t stop there.\nSeven luxury condominium units in the coveted Goldwynn Resort & Residences, boasting panoramic views of Goodman’s Bay, are also up for grabs, with a combined value of $7 million.\nNot to be outdone, four condos valued at $5 million in the esteemed One Cable Beach development are hitting the market, once inhabited by Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, including Singh and Wang.\nCommercial properties, valued at a whopping $25 million, are also on the chopping block, featuring prime office spaces in prestigious locations like the Veridian Corporate Center and Pineapple House.\nEven the West Bay property earmarked for FTX’s headquarters will change hands as the company liquidates its assets.\nThe sale isn’t confined to swanky resorts and corporate offices. An unspecified property on Blake Road and two sprawling lots in the exclusive Old Fort Bay enclave are also on offer.\nAs the fallout from the FTX cryptocurrency scandal continues to unfold, one luxurious Bahamian abode remains a symbol of lingering legal entanglements and unanswered questions.\nDubbed “Blue Water,” the sprawling 30,000-square-foot vacation home nestled in the exclusive enclave of Old Fort Bay stands as a testament to the opulent lifestyle once enjoyed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both Stanford Law professors.\nPurchased for a staggering $16.4 million in February 2022, Blue Water boasts beach views and epitomizes luxury living. However, its ownership has been shrouded in controversy since allegations surfaced that FTX footed the bill for the property.\nDespite assurances from Bankman and Fried that they intended to relinquish ownership voluntarily in the wake of FTX’s collapse, legal wrangling has persisted.\nAccording to court documents, the property’s title remains in their names, prompting FTX to pursue legal action against the couple.\nIn a recent twist, Bankman and his attorney, Krystal Rolle, informed Realtor.com that the property’s title had been transferred to a Bahamian company over a year ago.\nRolle asserted that the transfer had been finalized, potentially paving the way for the home’s sale to satisfy customer claims in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.\nHowever, concerns linger over whether the sale will recoup the property’s full value, with FTX’s attorneys raising allegations of negligence on the part of Bankman and Fried.\nAccusing the couple of turning a blind eye to FTX’s questionable business practices, they lambasted them for accepting a lavish home funded by the now-defunct company.\nAmid the legal quagmire, it remains unclear when Blue Water will hit the market, leaving its fate hanging in the balance as FTX’s bankruptcy administrators grapple with the complexities of untangling the web of deceit woven by Bankman-Fried and his associates.\nRequests for comment from FTX’s bankruptcy administrators went unanswered.\nAdvertisement","If the 2023 crypto venture landscape was an ice-cold pot of water, the first quarter of 2024 is the part where the bubbles start to form right before water boils, Tom Schmidt, a partner at Dragonfly Capital, said to TechCrunch.\nAnd he’s not wrong: $2.52 billion in total capital has been raised across the crypto and blockchain sectors in Q1 2024, according to PitchBook data. That’s about 25% higher than $2.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n“It’s been an extraordinarily busy time. It has 2021 feels to it,” said David Nage, portfolio manager at Arca. “Deals in 2021 felt like you had a gun to the back of your head; that feeling has kind of returned to the market a bit.” Nage said his firm has tracked over 690 deals across stages that have transpired during Q1, about 30 to 40% more than the lows in 2023.\n“In Q1, the crypto venture capital funding landscape was cautiously optimistic, rebounding from a challenging two-year period of fundraising difficulties for both companies and managers,” said Alex Felix, co-founder and chief investment officer at CoinFund.\nDespite a significant year-over-year decrease in both VC and crypto funding in 2023, around 65%, there is a noticeable uptick in deal-making activity, Felix added.\nThe crypto VC landscape has heated up in part because of positive effects from legal wins last year from Ripple and Grayscale, as well as positive sentiments around decentralized finance (DeFi) on Solana. There’s also demand increasing for the biggest cryptocurrency post SEC spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the U.S.\n“Another thing that affected the market is we didn’t die,” Nage said. “I know it’s funny to say this, but after the [collapse of] LUNA, BlockFi, FTX, the banking crisis, the thought was that we would die and we didn’t.”\nCan crypto’s recent wins resurrect venture interest?\nAnd it may not stop anytime soon, thanks to macro validation from crypto. “Crypto venture will continue to heat up on the back of a bullish macro backdrop fueled by the launch of crypto ETF products, the BTC halving, projected rate cuts in the U.S. ahead of the upcoming presidential election,” said Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Ventures. “We’re also seeing institutional interest start to convert into real budgets and products.”\nFor example, BlackRock is launching its tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, which could lead to heightened competitive pressure from traditional financial institutions and more adoptions.\nIn general, the crypto startup deal flow has picked up in areas ranging from DeFi to SocialFi to Bitcoin layer-2 growth. “We see 30 to 40 deals on a weekly basis, that’s increased 10% to 20% over the last quarter. It’s getting harder to keep up with the pace of that,” Nage said.\nThere has been an uptick in both new companies coming to market and existing companies that remained lean throughout the bear market that are revisiting fundraising, Giampapa said. “The market in 2024 will be a tale of the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots,’ with newer companies building along popular narratives getting funded at rich valuations and many other companies going out of business,” he added.\nRight now, SocialFi, which in web3 world refers mainly to decentralized social media, is very hot. Bi.social recently closed a $3 million round and decentralized social network protocol Mask Network hit $100 million for its fund to further support other similar applications. Some success in this sector can be thanks to decentralized social app networks like Farcaster, which is using Web 2.0 techniques to adopt new audiences. Web3 gaming is also rapidly expanding, with hundreds of new games expected to go to market later this year.\nCrypto and AI, blockchains and anything zero-knowledge related are “red-hot right now,” Schmidt said.\n“Given the grandiose expectations for AI’s potential to impact the global economy, we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future,” Tekin Salimi, founder of dao5, said.\nFor example, modular and AI-integrated blockchains, like 0G labs, which launched with a $35 million pre-seed round, are also attracting the attention of venture capitalists.\nCompetitiveness among VCs is creating an environment in which founders have greater leverage in fundraising, Salimi said. There’s “no shortage of hungry money as of recently,” said Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures.\n“This is founder-friendly in the sense that, in oversubscribed rounds, investors are now reverse-pitching their value,” said Marthe Naudts, associate at White Star Capital’s Digital Asset Fund, meaning that some investors have to show founders why they should choose them. “Founders now have optionality and the ability to set terms, with competitive rounds filling out before investors have time for intensive due diligence.”\nBut Felix says that the power hasn’t really shifted from investors to founders but is “perfectly balanced” for both parties. “Founders are benefiting from rounds catalyzed with more urgency and valuations ticking up slightly from their recent trough, and VCs are winning more protective and advantageous deal structures.”\nIt’s worth noting that there’s a massive dispersion based on the quality of the team and sector, Schmidt said. Some startups that previously raised during the last market cycle are working through a re-pricing through a down round or extension, while others are fresh faces.\nWith pre-seed rounds, there are under $10 million valuations in crypto consumer, but there are also $300 million or higher valuations for sectors like crypto and AI, Schmidt noted. For instance, PredX, an AI-enabled prediction market, raised $500,000 and was valued at $20 million post-money valuation, according to Messari data. Separately, CharacterX, a web3 AI social network, raised $2.8 million in a seed round at a $30 million post-money valuation.\nFor seed rounds, Nage is seeing $25 million to $40 million pre-money valuations, with several startups pricing in at the $80 million market on seed rounds. Schmidt said the average seed round is in a similar range of $30 million to $60 million post-valuation.\n“Valuations are up significantly, and even when larger, more established firms pass on a deal, founders still have plenty of options with others,” Anderson said. “Some of the valuation we’re seeing are already a bit outlandish given how early we are in this cycle.”\nBecause fundraise announcements are often delayed by many months to a year after the actual raise, there are misperceptions around where the private market is if participants are basing their expectations purely off headlines, Schmidt said.\n“Raises that would have taken months or not happened at all last year, even for high-quality teams, are now happening in weeks or less with better terms for founders,” Schmidt said. “Teams that squandered time and money during the bear market are still raising bridge rounds, but new teams are able to come out of the gate strong with larger raises and higher valuations.”\nThe valuation shift is also driven by sentiment around cryptocurrency prices, so bitcoin reaching all-time highs, Solana surpassing $200 and ether near $4,000 is a “massive sentiment shift,” Nage said.\nFor founders, seed rounds remain easiest to raise, as many small funds and angel investors are willing to write the first check at the lowest entry points, Felix said. “However, I do not anticipate an immediate improvement in the Series A graduation rate, which has declined from the upper 20% range to the mid-teens. Raising a round of more than $10 million will continue to be appropriately challenging.”\nMany venture capitalists are still trying to be mindful of not getting trapped into higher valuations by FOMO’ing into the hype, while also realizing that they can’t just sit on their hands and knees and wait it out. “It is common to see rounds get oversubscribed within days of coming to market and allocations being denied or shifted to subsequent rounds at higher valuations,” said Thomas Tang, VP of investments at Ryze Labs.\nSince the end of 2023, Nage said he’s been hearing from companies and peers that they’re looking at tokenomic designs for 2024. So there’s a new rise of token issuance and there’s a number of Arca’s portfolio companies that are working through building that out for this year. This is a shift from the mid-2022 post-Terra\/LUNA collapse era, when most seed deals were funded with Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) or warrants, he added.\n“This new issuance phase we’re entering into is that valuations have shifted violently,” Nage said.\nThis dynamic has driven VCs to accept “lofty valuations in private rounds since they expect that the tokens will be traded publicly at a significant markup,” Tang said.\nThat’s not to say there aren’t SAFE rounds still happening, but Schmidt said the market has congealed around those alongside priced equity rounds and token structures “as a way to give investors protection, but also give teams flexibility.”\nAnd it’s tougher for teams raising around traditional business models, said Clay Robbins, co-founder of accelerator and venture capital fund Colosseum. Crypto-native VCs see token trades and early liquidity behind it, so they’re heavily biased that way, while generalist investors don’t quite believe in that market yet, he added.\nOn that point, Naudts said the long-term performance of these tokens is yet to be seen. Her firm, White Star, is cautious of tokens intended both as a speculative asset and a means of payment. “But we’re seeing lots more experimentation with tokenomics models here and it’s certainly a space where we are excited by the innovation at play.”\nThe early-stage funding space will continue to heat up throughout the remainder of the year, Robbins said. Given the “relatively anemic IPO market, lack of fundamentals-based underwriting of growth-stage crypto companies and a (now confirmed) trial between the SEC and Coinbase, I anticipate it will be inconsistent at the growth stage.”\nAnd April will be a big month for crypto market sentiment. As the Bitcoin Halving is coming up, which only occurs once every four years, there’s a lot of uncertainty on how that will affect the industry. Past halving events have propelled the price of bitcoin, but historical data doesn’t always predict the future.\n“While short-term market corrections may be on the horizon, we expect the next three quarters of 2024 to be very bullish,” Salimi said. “Historically, financial markets make positive gains during election years. Additionally, we anticipate the macro environment to begin improving later this year, manifesting first in interest rate cuts.”\nAnd relative to last year, many venture capitalists are certain — if there aren’t any massive fraud cases, lawsuits or negative regulatory effects — that the market will continue to see hyper VC activity in the coming quarters that it saw in Q1. “Regulation continues to be the wild card here and could serve as a catalyst for either another leg higher or a brake on growth,” Giampapa said.\nIf there’s positive progress on the regulatory front, real on-chain momentum, more institutional-based products being launched and continued overall improved macroenvironment, there could be “frenzy levels of deployment,” Robbins said.\n“There will be more activity, more deal flow and one thing above everything else is funds are raising capital,” Nage said. Many firms weren’t able to raise from LPs last year because the industry “was a death knell and no interest was out there from LPs.”\nAs the industry moves on from FTX, LPs are also warming back up to the space, but some are also beginning to differentiate between “crypto” and “crypto venture,” which may lead to some choosing to just allocate to Bitcoin and leave it at that for their crypto exposure, Schmidt said.\nHowever, traditional VCs or crossover funds haven’t “plunged head-first back into crypto, but they’re slowly dipping their toes into a few more deals,” Schmidt said. “I would not be surprised if things get frothier as those bigger market participants come back, crypto funds go back out to the market to reload on capital from LPs, and the space overall becomes more institutionally attractive again.”\nRegardless, the sentiment has shifted dramatically over the last quarter, so as that continues to improve, it should also create positive effects on the venture market, Nage added. “If [firms] can raise funds in the next two to three quarters, they won’t hold on to their past dry powder as aggressively as they did the past year. As that eases, you’ll see more checks.”\nLast year, most funds were doing about one to two deals a month, or a few a quarter, Nage said. “That has dramatically changed. In December alone, we’ve done half a dozen, if not more.” All the deals Nage is in talks with this most recent quarter were time constrained.\nBy comparison, Felix shared that CoinFund closed 17 deals in 2023 and four deals in the first quarter of 2024.\nLast year, a total of $10.18 billion in capital was raised across the crypto and blockchain industry, PitchBook data showed. I asked each firm how much capital they expect to be raised by the end of 2024 and most estimated above that $10 billion range, but some went as high as the $20 billion range.\nFelix believes that VC funding to web3 could be more than 10% of global dollars raised so that could be as much as $16.2 billion at year end based on PitchBook’s 2023 fundraising figures. Either way, it’s expected to be short of the nearly $30 billion that crypto startups raised in 2022, and the more than $33 billion they raised back in 2021.\n“This market falls somewhere between the mania of 2021, 2022 and the muted market of last year,” Robbins said.\nWhile Giampapa also thinks many managers will accelerate deployments and go out to fundraise in the next six to 12 months, there’s a caveat. In the previous bull market, some of the large deployers of capital were firms like FTX and Three Arrows Capital, which are no longer in business. “Without these pools of capital, I struggle to see how dollars deployed into crypto VC get back to the 2021 to 2022 levels.”\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Crypto\nJacquelyn Melinek was a reporter at TechCrunch covering cryptocurrency.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nCathie Wood is the head of Ark Investment Management, which operates 14 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on technological innovations. They include everything from artificial intelligence (AI) to electric vehicles to cryptocurrency.\nArk is extremely bullish on the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). The firm's official research implies the coin could deliver a gain of 2,000% by 2030, but Wood herself just came out with a new price target that points to a potential upside of more than 5,300%.\nBitcoin is trading near an all-time high right now and investors are as enthusiastic about its prospects as ever, but is Wood's forecast realistic?\nBitcoin is often discussed as a replacement for traditional money. It isn't governed by any person or institution, and the blockchain upon which it is built is an accurate and transparent system of record. But its price is incredibly volatile; Bitcoin lost 65% of its value in 2022 and it has since gained about 325% from its low point that year. As a result, it's too unpredictable to become a means of exchange for most consumers and businesses.\nMany investors instead consider Bitcoin a store of value -- like a digital version of gold -- and it has outperformed every other major asset class during the past five years:\nThe investment thesis behind Bitcoin is relatively simple. Supply is limited to 21 million coins, which are paid to miners who use powerful computers to add new blocks to the blockchain. A halving is triggered with every 210,000 new blocks, which cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half. Estimates suggest the last Bitcoin will be mined sometime around the year 2140.\nSince supply is capped, demand alone drives the price. There are nearly 50 million wallets which hold entire bitcoins or partial coins. That figure is near an all-time high. Plus, 2023 was one of the most active years for wallet creation, which is a good indicator of demand. Theoretically, Bitcoin's limited supply will ensure prices move higher for as long as people continue opening new wallets to buy the cryptocurrency.\nHowever, that alone might not be enough for Bitcoin to deliver the astronomical gains touted by Ark and Wood.\nArk highlights eight potential sources of demand for Bitcoin that could send its price soaring by 2030:\nCorporate treasury: Ark believes companies will eventually hold between 0% (bear case) and 5% (bull case) of their cash reserves in Bitcoin.\nRemittance asset: Bitcoin could represent between 5% and 25% of all non-commercial money transfers.\nNation state treasury: Government treasury departments around the world could hold between 0% and 5% of their assets in Bitcoin.\nEmerging market currency: Bitcoin could be the primary currency in some developing nations. El Salvador already adopted it as legal tender.\nEconomic settlement network: Bitcoin could eliminate a number of fees imposed by banks and financial institutions, capturing between 1% and 10% of U.S. bank settlement volume.\nSeizure-resistant asset: Between 1% and 5% of the global wealth held by high net worth individuals could be stored in Bitcoin to protect it from the government.\nInstitutional investment: Banks and financial institutions could place between 1% and 6.5% of their assets in Bitcoin because they believe it will further appreciate in value.\nDigital gold: Between 20% and 50% of the money investors normally allocate to gold could eventually be placed in Bitcoin instead, thanks to its strong performance and portability.\nHere's how high Ark believes Bitcoin can rise by 2030 based on the demand generated by those eight catalysts:\nBear case: $258,500, representing an upside of about 270% from today's price of roughly $69,000.\nBase case: $682,800, representing an upside of 880%.\nBull case: $1,480,000, representing an upside of 2,400%.\nWood spoke at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York last week, where she said Bitcoin could actually eclipse Ark's 2030 price target of $1.48 million and instead soar to $3.8 million. The 5,300% upside could be driven by further adoption of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which won the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.\nSo far, the 10 approved ETF operators -- including Ark -- manage more than $58 billion worth of assets in their Bitcoin funds, and that figure is growing. Wood says if institutional investors allocated a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that alone would be enough to warrant a price of $3.8 million.\nWood thinks Bitcoin still has miles to go in terms of upside. She believes the cryptocurrency is key to an internet-based means of transacting that eliminates toll takers like banks and financial institutions, which collect a fee almost every time money moves.\nPast performance doesn't predict future results, so there is no guarantee Bitcoin will continue to outperform other asset classes, let alone surge more than 50-fold.\nThe cryptocurrency would have a market capitalization of $74.7 trillion if it did reach a price of $3.8 million, making it nearly three times more valuable than the U.S. economy by gross domestic product, and 23 times more valuable than the largest company in the world (Microsoft).\nTo me, that seems unlikely. Treating Bitcoin as a store of value does make sense, and perhaps one day it could have a similar market cap to gold, which currently stands at $14.6 trillion. That would translate to a 10-fold return in Bitcoin from here, taking it to $743,500, which is slightly above Ark's base-case estimate.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.
