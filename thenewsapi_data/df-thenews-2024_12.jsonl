(NASDAQ\/TSX: BITF), a global leader in vertically integrated Bitcoin data center operations, today announced its latest monthly production report. All financial references are in U.S. dollars.\nBitfarms achieved an operating hashrate of 12.8 EH\/s in November with initial deployment of miners to Stronghold Digital Mining’s sites in Pennsylvania under the hosting agreements announced in September and October 2024. With these two hosting agreements, supporting a total of approximately 4 EH\/s, nearly 75% of Bitfarms’ hashrate is expected to come from North American data centers by the first half of 2025, re-affirming the Company’s commitment to grow in the U.S.\nIn November, Bitfarms also upgraded nearly 19,000 T21 miners to S21 Pro miners with delivery anticipated in December and January. These newer, more efficient miners will support improved efficiency of 19 w\/TH, a nearly 10% improvement from current efficiency, in the first half of 2025.\nCEO Ben Gagnon stated, “By redirecting our miners to be deployed in the United States, we have best matched our miners with the underlying electricity economics across our large portfolio of flexible MWs. With demand for immediate capacity for both HPC\/AI and BTC mining surging and based on discussions with strategic partners, I am confident that our energy portfolio of over 950 MW in 2025 gives us unparalleled flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities in both HPC\/AI and BTC mining.”\nIn addition, Bitfarms conducted its Special Meeting of shareholders on November 20, resulting in shareholder approval of the expansion of the Board of Directors from five to six members and the appointment of Andrew J. Chang as an Independent Director. The Board is now comprised of six members, five of whom are independent.\nLastly, Bitfarms announces that Benoit Gobeil, Chief Infrastructure Officer, resigned from the Company effective at the end of November. During his tenure, Mr. Gobeil played a key role in scaling Bitfarms data center facilities across North and Latin America.\nCEO Ben Gagnon concluded, “Benoit has been with Bitfarms since 2018 and has been an important member of our leadership team. Over the years, he built an infrastructure team around him that we believe is best-in-class in designing, constructing, and maintaining high- performing Bitcoin data centers. With this team in place, I am confident of a smooth transition as we expedite the recruitment process for a replacement. As we look to fill this role, we believe this is an opportunity to further strengthen our team and bring in someone with HPC\/AI and U.S.-based data center construction management experience. The entire Bitfarms team is grateful for Benoit’s dedication and contributions, and we wish him success with his future endeavors.”\nMining ReviewNovember mining operations generated 204 BTC compared to 236 BTC in October, reflecting a 1% increase in average operating EH and a 7% increase in Bitcoin difficulty.\nNovember 2024 Select Operating Highlights\nBitfarms’ BTC Monthly Production\nNovember 2024 Financial Update\nUpcoming Conferences and Events\nAbout Bitfarms Ltd.\nFounded in 2017, Bitfarms is a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center company that contributes its computational power to one or more mining pools from which it receives payment in Bitcoin.

Traders often employ two key strategies: long and short positions, each with distinct characteristics and purposes. While the mechanics of these positions share similarities across both markets, there are nuanced differences, particularly in the crypto space.\nFor instance, shorting assets requires a firm grasp of market dynamics and can be approached via various methods, including margin trading and futures. Whether you’re speculating on price drops in crypto or hedging in forex, it’s essential to understand how these strategies function, their associated risks, and how platforms can provide unique avenues for traders looking to utilize their holdings in different ways.\nDid you ever wonder why some traders bet on prices rising while others back them to fall? We’ll investigate what motivates traders to go for long or short trades in both Forex and crypto, and identify key similarities and differences between each strategy in both markets.\nTable of contents:\nIn crypto trading, a ‘short position’ is a strategy where a trader bets on the price of a cryptocurrency decreasing over time. Taking a short position involves selling an asset with the expectation that its price will fall, allowing the trader to buy it back later at a lower price to make a profit. Short positions in crypto can be executed through several methods, including direct margin trading, futures contracts, or tokenized short products.\nSolana is one cryptocurrency that is especially prone to movement as it has become one of the most widely used digital currencies and ways for traders to maximize profits. For example, in the eCommerce industry, Solana is being widely adopted as a payment method to purchase all manner of goods and services.\nMeanwhile, in the Gaming industry, those using the best Solana casino platforms enjoy lightning-fast transactions, minimal fees, and instant payouts, allowing you to quickly capitalize on market changes without delays. Additionally, exclusive casino bonuses and promotions provide extra funds, maximizing your potential profits and flexibility while trading and gaming.\nWhen you take a short position on a crypto like Solana, you essentially ‘borrow’ a cryptocurrency that you don’t own and sell it at the current market price, hoping to repurchase it later at a lower price. If the price falls as expected, you can buy back the crypto at a reduced price and return it to the lender, pocketing the difference as profit. However, if the price rises, you’ll need to buy it back at a higher price, resulting in a loss.\nFor example, if you anticipate a price drop for Solana (SOL) trading at $100, you can short the asset by borrowing 10 SOL, selling them for $1,000, and then buying back the 10 SOL after the price drops to $80, totaling $800, resulting in a $200 profit.\nA short position in crypto is a strategy to profit from declining prices by selling high and buying back low. While potentially profitable, shorting crypto carries significant risks due to the volatility, leverage, and potential for unlimited losses in rising markets. Shorting requires precise market analysis, effective risk management, and a solid understanding of various methods, including margin trading, futures, and inverse products. Given the unpredictability of crypto markets, shorting is typically suited for experienced traders who can manage the heightened risks.\nIn forex trading, a short position involves selling a currency pair with the expectation that the value of the base currency (the first currency in the pair) will decline relative to the quote currency (the second currency). Taking a short position means that you believe the exchange rate will decrease, allowing you to buy back the currency at a lower price and profit from the difference. In forex, going short is common and straightforward, as currencies are always traded in pairs—when you short one currency, you’re effectively going long on the other.\nWhen taking a short position, you’re essentially borrowing or selling the base currency and simultaneously buying the quote currency. You’ll profit if the value of the base currency decreases relative to the quote currency, allowing you to repurchase it at a lower price. Short positions are fundamental in forex trading, as traders can easily go long or short based on their market outlook without needing to own the currency beforehand.\nConsider the EUR\/USD currency pair, where the base currency is the euro (EUR) and the quote currency is the U.S. dollar (USD). If EUR\/USD is currently trading at 1.1000, this means that 1 euro is worth 1.10 U.S. dollars.\nTaking a short position in forex involves selling a currency pair with the expectation that the base currency will decrease in value relative to the quoted currency. Forex markets allow traders to go short just as easily as going long, enabling them to profit in both uptrends and downtrends. Effective shorting requires a solid understanding of market factors, technical and fundamental analysis, and risk management practices. While shorting offers substantial profit potential, particularly when using leverage, it also comes with high risk due to the unpredictable and often volatile nature of forex markets.\nIn essence, the core principles of short selling—selling high and buying low—apply in both crypto and forex markets, despite the different asset types.\nThese differences make shorting in crypto riskier and potentially more rewarding than shorting in forex.\nIn crypto trading, a long position involves purchasing a cryptocurrency with the expectation that its price will increase over time, allowing the trader to sell it later at a higher price for a profit. Similar to long positions in forex or stocks, a crypto long position is fundamentally a bet on the future appreciation of the asset. However, due to the unique nature of cryptocurrency markets—known for their high volatility, 24\/7 trading, and relative lack of regulatory oversight—taking a long position in crypto requires additional considerations and strategies.\nWhen you take a long position in crypto, you are buying a cryptocurrency asset, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or another altcoin, with the anticipation that its market value will rise. In practice, this could mean either simply buying and holding the crypto asset (often called “HODLing”) or using leverage to amplify the position through margin trading.\nImagine you decide to take a long position on Ethereum (ETH) because you expect that an upcoming upgrade or widespread adoption will drive up its value.\nIn summary, a long position in crypto involves buying a cryptocurrency with the expectation that its price will rise over time. Traders aim to profit by purchasing the asset at a lower price and selling it at a higher price later. Traders can take a long position through straightforward purchase, leverage, or futures contracts, each with varying degrees of risk and reward.\nIn forex trading, a long position involves buying a currency pair with the expectation that the value of the first currency in the pair, known as the base currency, will rise relative to the second currency, known as the quote currency. A long position is typically taken by a trader who anticipates that the base currency will appreciate (gain value) or that the quote currency will depreciate (lose value) in the near or long-term future, allowing the trader to sell it later at a higher price.\nWhen you take a long position in forex, you’re essentially purchasing the base currency and selling the equivalent amount of the quote currency. In forex trading, currencies are always quoted in pairs, such as EUR\/USD (Euro\/US Dollar), USD\/JPY (US Dollar\/Japanese Yen), or GBP\/USD (British Pound\/US Dollar). Each pair represents the value of one currency against another, with the base currency coming first.\nFor instance, if you take a long position in the EUR\/USD pair:\nForex traders go long for various reasons:\nIn summary, a long position in forex involves betting that the base currency will increase in value relative to the quote currency. If the trader’s prediction is correct, they can close the position for a profit. However, if the currency pair moves against them, they risk a loss. Taking a long position requires careful analysis, strategic risk management, and often, the use of stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage potential outcomes.\nIn essence, the mechanics of taking a long position—buying with the hope of price appreciation—are the same in both crypto and forex markets.\nThese differences influence the risk, execution, and overall trading experience when taking long positions in crypto versus forex.\nWhereas payment methods like credit cards and even bank transfers can take several working days to complete, modern payment methods including digital wallets and cryptocurrency offer instant or real-time payments.

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\nThe biggest cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin is losing its hold on market supremacy, therefore changing the crypto scene. Analysts believe cryptocurrencies may soon take the spotlight as their market share drops to 55.80% and a confirmed sell signal flashes for the first time since 2020. As Bitcoin’s price battles to sustain its momentum and falls below important trendline support, this sentiment picks traction.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) indicating Bitcoin’s dominance is trading below its midline, therefore reinforcing negative expectations. Such situations have historically cleared the path for what is known as “altseason”—a time when other cryptocurrencies shine above Bitcoin. Experts contend that capital from Bitcoin could move into altcoins, generating instability and fresh investing prospects.\nThe sell signal has just flashed on the Bitcoin dominance for the first time since 2020\nLet the real fun of #ALTSEASON begins pic.twitter.com\/R9QeCO69YH\n— Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) December 3, 2024\nThis trend corresponds with the lowered holdings among long-term Bitcoin investors, hence it is not only theoretical. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that wallets containing Bitcoin for more than 155 days currently only possess about 12.45 million BTC, the lowest number since mid-2022. These balances, declining almost 10%, point to some individuals cashing in gains or shifting their money to cold wallets.\nAs the anticipated $100,000 goal for the alpha coin gets closer, Bitcoin’s price has run into strong resistance. Multiple failures at $97,500 have led to big drops. Bitcoin fell even more on Tuesday, selling around $93,940. This volatility is matched by a clear drop in long-term assets, which makes it hard to tell where the market is going.\nBitcoin long-term holders are gradually reducing their balances, now holding 12.45 million BTC—the lowest level since July 2022.\nSo far, this decline is less severe than in past cycles. Long-term holder balances have fallen by 9.8% this cycle, compared to 15% in 2021 and 26% in… pic.twitter.com\/eA5Cckrgs4\n— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 3, 2024\nAlthough the present drop in holdings is less significant than those in 2021 or 2017, it draws attention to shifting market attitude. Some observers say this conduct shows purposeful repositioning by experienced investors trying to fit changing market conditions.\nEven with the negative undertones, a rare bullish indication gives some hope. Recently in line with moving averages, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicates that Bitcoin might rally in the next one to two months. Such signs are rare, only once or twice during an upward market cycle.\nAlthough the bearish pressure is still evident, experts note that these positive signals provide risk-tolerant investors some good possibilities. Consistent with past patterns following halving events, market observers are also preparing for a possible slump as January 2025 draws near.\nFor now, the declining dominance and increasing volatility of Bitcoin highlight the need of a careful yet strategic approach. Whether it’s Altseason or a fresh Bitcoin surge, the next months could change the scene of cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView\nThey say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn.\nChristian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later).\nChristian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley!\nSo, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill).\nThink Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair.\nSpeaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better.\nHere's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies.\nLooking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.\nSo, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly.

While market makers' hedging is likely to keep BTC supported at around $100,000, the heightened activity raises the risk of pullbacks for other cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, tapped a record high above $103,000 early Thursday, following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint pro-crypto Paul Atkins as chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe breakout sent traders chasing the price rally, pushing funding rates for perpetual futures skywards, a sign of growing demand for and overcrowding in long positions. In this scenario, a slight pullback can result in large liquidations (forced selling by exchanges due to margin shortages) and increased downside volatility.\nSupport may come from the options market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. When options prices rise faster than that of the underlying asset — that is, when the so-called gamma imbalance is positive — market makers tend to sell their holdings to keep their net exposure neutral. They buy when it's negative, acting as a contrarian force and limiting price swings.\n\"BTC can be stable at around $100,000 in the short-term, helped by the hedging activity of market makers,\" Ardern told CoinDesk. \"This support from the options market may offset the impact of deleveraging to a certain extent.\"\nThe annualized funding rate for bitcoin surged to nearly 100%, surpassing rates for purely speculative tokens like DOGE, data from VeloData show. Other coins, such as XRP, CRO and XMR, also boast funding rates in excess of 100%.\n\"That EOD [volume weighted average price] suggests Saylor blew another few billion, and the [BTC] funding rates make me think this final move was purely lever-driven,\" said Felix Hartmann, founder and managing partner of Hartmann Capital, referring to Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin. \"Wouldn’t be shocked at a good old 20-30% bull market correction here. 80s are fair game.\"\nHartmann stressed the need for additional demand over and above MSTR's purchases to keep the bull run going, a view echoed by several observers on social media. They suggested that either the market continues to rally, justifying the costs associated with holding bullish bets, or turns lower in a sharp correction.\nEven with market makers' activity, bitcoin price volatility could return toward the end of the year.\n\"The positive gamma at $105,000 in options expiring on Dec. 27 could bring sufficient gravity, but after the expiry, it will disappear, boosting price uncertainty,\" Ardern told CoinDesk.\nOptions are derivative contracts, offering the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call or a bullish bet gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

It’s like gold—it’s just virtual and digital,” Powell said during the discussion.\nPowell dispelled notions that Bitcoin undermines the Federal Reserve or the strength of the U.S. dollar and highlighted that Bitcoin is not being used as a primary form of payment or as a reliable store of value due to its high volatility.\nDon’t Miss:\nOver the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nBitcoin has been surged back toward the psychological $100,000 per bitcoin milestone after wild swing — one of the most global crypto trading platforms is offering $10 of free crypto for new sign ups today!\n“It’s not a competitor for the dollar. It’s really a competitor for gold,” he added.\nAsked about a potential national Bitcoin reserve, Powell stressed the Federal Reserve’s objective of keeping the banking system “safe and sound.”\nPossible interaction between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the traditional financial banking system should not threaten the latter’s health, Powell said.\nHe further pointed out that it isn’t the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.\nAsked whether he owns any Bitcoin himself, Powell said “he is not allowed” to own it.\nAlso Read: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26\/share with a $1000 minimum.\nPowell also discussed the state of the U.S. economy, saying it “is in remarkably good shape.”\nPowell attributed this strength to stable growth and decreasing inflation.\nHe noted that the economy is growing at approximately 2.5% annually, while inflation has decreased from over 7% to around 2.3%, all while maintaining steady unemployment rates.\nThis economic stability allows the Federal Reserve the flexibility to adopt a cautious approach towards reaching a “neutral” interest rate level.\nThis methodical approach aims to minimize risks; moving too quickly might reverse progress on inflation, while a slow approach might hurt the labor market.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

PLTR, Peter Thiel, is known for his early conviction in Bitcoin BTC\/USD, and his Founders Fund has been reaping substantial gains from the asset.\nWhat happened: The San Francisco-based venture capital fund reportedly began buying into the leading cryptocurrency in 2014, making a handsome $1.8 billion by selling before the 2022 market collapse.\nHowever, the firm made a bold return, parking nearly $100 million in Bitcoin between late summer and early fall of 2023.\nInterestingly, Bitcoin was trading in the $25,000-$30,000 range at the time, right before the bullish run that would propel the asset to unprecedented levels.\nTaking $30,000 as a ballpark figure, let's assume you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin at the time. It would have fetched you 0.033 BTC.\nSee Also: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Drives MicroStrategy’s 490% Surge, Hedge Fund CIO Says It’s An ‘Extreme Example’ Of Volatility Monetization\nCut to Dec. 2024, Bitcoin has scaled the $100,000 milestone, exchanging hands at $102,550 as of this writing.\nThis would boost your Bitcoin portfolio to $3,384.15, marking an impressive 238.15% return.\nFurthermore, if we extend the same methodology to Founders Fund investments, presuming they haven't yet cashed out, a $100 million investment at $30,000 per unit BTC would equal $338.15 million today.\nWhy It Matters: Interestingly, Thiel, in an interview in July, appeared doubtful about Bitcoin's potential for future growth.\n\"I'm not sure it's going to go up that dramatically from here. We got the ETF edition, and I don't know who else buys it,\" he had said.\nHis views were influenced by the digital asset’s increased mainstreaming or corporatization, a departure from its initial vision as a cypherpunk, crypto-anarchist, and anti-establishment freedom tool.\nThat said, Thiel, who personally holds Bitcoin, regretted not buying more of the digital currency.\nPrice Action: As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $101,824.80, up 5.44% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nImage via Wikimedia Commons\nRead Next:\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

You won't want to start your day without it.\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nYou know how it feels when you're watching a match, both teams score and you end up with a draw? So, that's the bitcoin market right now.\nThe bulls pushed prices above $103,000 early Thursday, only for the bears to bite back, crashing prices to $91,000. As it stands, we’re trading steadily around $98,000. Talk about undecided ...\nThe crash shook out leveraged crypto futures bets worth around $1 billion, bringing a degree of normality to what had become an overheated market. That's possibly a blessing in disguise, because had BTC surged all the way up to $120,000, the eventual leverage shakeout would have been even more severe and could have potentially damaged investor confidence.\nThe glass-half-full perspective is supported by bitcoin spot ETFs, which managed to pull in a net $766 million despite the chaos.\nBut there's a glass-half-empty side too. The ProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF, which tracks twice the inverse of bitcoin’s daily performance, also saw a net inflow as well as record trading volume. While the $7 million added is small compared with the long spot ETFs, it shows the bears are ready to make their presence felt.\nIf it all feels a little shaky, there's more to come, with the chance of downside volatility if U.S. nonfarm payrolls data points to a resilient labour market and sticky wage pressures. That would prompt a recalibration of Fed rate-cut expectations and possibly hurt crypto prices. Weak data, conversely, could yield a price bounce, although trading directionally might be tricky while prices are this indecisive.\nIn other news, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of David Sacks as Crypto and AI Czar (which might seem like the opposite of crypto’s decentralization ethos) is being viewed positively for Solana’s ETF prospects. Why? Because at one point, Sacks was associated with the crypto hedge fund Multicoin, one of Solana's early investors. It seems farfetched, but hey it's a typical bull-market narrative.\nLooking at the broader market, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is quickly approaching the $4.6 billion market value of Arbitrum's ARB token in a move that indicates application-specific layer 2s like Hyperliquid are becoming the \"real value capture mechanisms for DeFi applications,\" according to Gautham Santosh, founder of Polynomial Protocol.\nGautham noted on X that building on general-purpose layer 2s could mean constructing someone else's moat, essentially translating your success into their token value. He points out that while Arbitrum-based perpetual protocol GMX generates 54% more revenue than Hyperliquid, its market cap stands at just $376 million or just 8% of Hyperliquid's.\nThat's a lot to take in for today. So, as trader Alex Kruger said on X, \"If you're not a full-time trader, focus on portfolio construction.\" Stay alert out there!\nBy Shaurya MalwaEthereum and Base memecoin mog (MOG) surged 40% to set fresh highs Friday on the back of a Coinbase spot market listing. It becomes the second-largest cat-themed token behind Solana-based popcat (POPCAT)\nThe memecoin is known for its distinctive branding around the meme of a cat laughing with tears (often represented by the \"joycat\" emoji 😹) and sporting Pit Viper sunglasses. This token doesn't boast any intrinsic utility, thriving instead on its community-driven ethos and the virality of meme culture within the cryptocurrency space.\nMeme coins often rely on community hype, and MOG has successfully captured a zeitgeist with its humorous and culturally resonant branding driving demand.\nIts cult community often appears to 'mog' other token communities (a slang term for outperforming) on social posts or in replies on X — and that has become a meme itself, further fueling the token’s popularity.\nSpot BTC ETFs:\nSpot ETH ETFs\nSource: Farside Investors\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nThe crypto market has begun the week on a negative note, with bitcoin (BTC) lower after a weekend spent wrestling with the $100,000 mark amid reports that Amazon shareholders are pushing for an allocation to the cryptocurrency. The persistent indecisiveness since Dec. 5 amid increased retail participation has some indicators pointing to a mid-bull cycle top.\nFor example, BTC's value days destroyed (VDD) indicator, a velocity gauge, has jumped to 2.0 from 0.5, signaling that older coins are being sold. As the founder of 10x Research, Markus Thielen, points out, \"This often reflects profit-taking by long-term holders, a behavior typical in the later stages of a bull market.\" Luckily for the bulls, VDD is still below the critical 3.8 level, marking the end of previous bull markets. The popular MVRV ratio supports this idea, rising to 2.7x in a move Thielen calls a hint of a mid-cycle peak where many investors contemplate taking profits.\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor faced a backlash on social media for urging the U.S. to replace gold with BTC in its reserves, leaving America's enemies with a worthless asset. At least that's an improvement compared with the maxi narrative of late 2020 that suggested BTC would replace the USD, or is it? The cheesy take has some wondering whether the bullish cycle is about to peak.\nEther is also feeling the pressure, posting even larger losses than bitcoin and dampening hopes for a recovery in the ether-bitcoin ratio. Despite this, retail interest remains robust, with open interest in ETH perpetuals rising to $843 million on leading decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, exceeding BTC's $616 million. This follows record inflows of $836 million into ether ETFs last week.\n\"This indicates significant retail interest in ETF flows,\" said Toe Bautista, a research analyst at GSR. \"Most carry trades are on CME versus Hyperliquid, so this interest seems to reflect sticky retail capital that could fuel the next leg up.\"\nOn a positive note for ETH, the DeFi sector, which primarily operates on Ethereum, is booming. Last week, TradingView's DeFi market cap index surged over 28% to $151.9 billion, its highest since early 2022. This increase has reduced ether's inflation rate to 0.3% and was accompanied by a 71% rise in DEX trading volumes, a 39% increase in network revenue and a 20x surge in total blob fees.\nFrax Finance’s FXS token fell despite an expected major upgrade announcement, while Aptos’ APT token dropped 7% ahead of a $165 million token unlock on Dec. 11. Altcoins are gaining increased search interest on Google, as shown in today’s chart.\nIn traditional markets, U.S. equity futures held steady, with China’s Politburo announcing more proactive fiscal and loose monetary policies, prompting the 10-year Chinese government bond yield to drop below 2%. (Are bonds pricing in a potential Chinese QE?) Stay alert!\nBy Shaurya MalwaOver the weekend, Ethereum-based Pepe (PEPE) zoomed to a record $11 billion market capitalization, continuing its correlation as a beta bet on the network as ether (ETH) leapt to an eight-month high.\nPEPE has gained more than 23% in the past seven days, with trading volumes increasing from an average of $2 billion to over $8 billion in that period.\nThat move made the token the first among the relatively new memes from 2023 — a cohort that includes bonk, dogwifhat, and mog, among others — the first to eclipse a landmark $10 billion market cap.\nGains in pepe likely tracked those of ether, which has outperformed bitcoin (BTC) and other major tokens with an 8% rise in the past seven days.\nSince late 2023, meme tokens have been increasingly seen as a beta — or a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain.\nSome PEPE whales increased their holdings by roughly 1.1 billion tokens over the weekend, suggesting strong institutional or large investor interest in expectations of a higher move, according to Lookonchain data.\nSpot BTC ETFs:\nSpot ETH ETFs\nSource: Farside Investors\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

This dramatic event, triggered a cascade of events that sent shockwaves through the digital asset ecosystem.  Crypto analyst Ash Crypto provided an analysis of the market dynamics leading to this sharp decline, shedding light on the sequence of events and the potential implications for the future of cryptocurrency prices.\nThe sell-off originated on the Coinbase exchange, approximately an hour before the broader market decline.  Traders on Coinbase initiated selling pressure, which inadvertently triggered a domino effect of liquidations across various cryptocurrency trading platforms.  This initial selling pushed prices down toward a critical liquidation zone, where pre-set stop-loss orders were activated.  Stop-loss orders are designed to limit potential losses by automatically selling an asset when its price falls to a specific level.  However, in this instance, the concentrated execution of stop-loss orders exacerbated the downward pressure, creating a chain reaction of further selling and liquidations.\nThe market downturn was further fueled by the prevailing conditions of high Open Interest (OI) and elevated funding fees.  High OI indicated a significant number of open futures contracts, suggesting a large amount of leveraged positions in the market. As prices declined, leveraged traders were forced to liquidate their positions, adding to the selling pressure.  Simultaneously, high funding fees, which represent the cost of holding leveraged positions, incentivized some traders to close their positions to avoid further costs, contributing to the overall selling momentum.  This combination of high OI, high funding fees, and triggered stop-loss orders created a perfect storm for the massive liquidation event.\nHowever, amidst the widespread sell-off, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as a relative haven for traders.  Its comparatively smaller drawdown compared to Bitcoin (BTC) made it an attractive option for those seeking refuge from the market turmoil.  This preference for ETH led to a renewed buying pressure, helping to stabilize its price while other cryptocurrencies continued to decline.  Conversely, XRP, despite its potential for price spikes, experienced a significant drop of over 12%, reaching as low as $2.06.  This decline was attributed to the relatively thin liquidity of XRP, making it more susceptible to large price swings during periods of market volatility.  Interestingly, Cardano (ADA), USD Coin (USDC), and FDUSD saw a substantial increase in trading volume during this period, possibly indicating a flight to stability or opportunistic trading strategies.\nDespite the severity of the initial sell-off, the cryptocurrency market demonstrated resilience, with signs of recovery emerging relatively quickly. Bitcoin’s price stabilized, experiencing only a minor decline of 0.68% within 24 hours of the event.  Other altcoins, including Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB), also began to rebound from their steep falls. This rapid recovery suggests that the market may have absorbed the initial shock and found a new equilibrium.\nThe liquidation event can be interpreted as a cleansing process, eliminating “weak hands” or less committed investors from the market while creating opportunities for more experienced traders, often referred to as “smart money,” to accumulate assets at discounted prices.  This dynamic, coupled with underlying positive factors, points toward a potential for a swift market recovery.  Analyst Ash Crypto projected a rapid price rebound, suggesting that the market’s fundamental strengths remain intact.\nSeveral factors support the optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency market.  MicroStrategy’s substantial $2.1 billion Bitcoin purchase earlier in the week underscored the continued institutional interest in the digital asset. This large investment serves as a testament to the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.  Furthermore, influential figures like Robert Kiyosaki, author of the popular personal finance book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” publicly advocated for buying Bitcoin during the dip, reinforcing the narrative of a buying opportunity.  These factors, combined with the market’s intrinsic tendency to rebound after periods of correction, suggest a positive trajectory for cryptocurrency prices in the near future.  While the market remains subject to volatility, the underlying strength and growing institutional adoption indicate a potential for sustained growth.\nLogin to your account below."]}

While it hovers just below the $100,000 mark, many investors are asking themselves the same question: Is there still time to buy? If you're willing to remain patient, the answer is shockingly clear.\nBitcoin was launched in the early days of 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis. At the time, it had almost no following, with a single Bitcoin trading for just pennies. Today, nearly everyone has heard of the cryptocurrency. Its market cap is north of $1 trillion, and millions of people personally own Bitcoin, either directly or through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The cryptocurrency has simply been one of the best investments of all time, with a trading price that is now approaching $100,000. It crossed this threshold in recent weeks, but a correction pushed the price under $100,000. While many believe Bitcoin's best days are behind it, this could be just the beginning.\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\nTo be clear, don't expect Bitcoin's historical returns to be replicated in the future. However, there's reason to believe that there's still plenty of upside potential for long-term holders.\nMy No. 1 reason to remain invested in Bitcoin is its attractiveness as a store of value. Unlike most investments that follow the financial prospects of a company or business opportunity, stores of value don't produce cash flow or dividends. Instead, they simply represent a medium that a critical mass of people agrees is worth something of value, even if that value is mostly social or symbolic. Gold -- another popular store of value -- has been valued by humans for generations. Its market cap is currently around $18 trillion. Bitcoin's market cap, meanwhile, remains under $2 trillion.\nIt will take years, if not decades, for Bitcoin's reputation to catch up with gold's. But if it does match gold's market cap, there would be more than 900% in additional upside. That's a very fair return, even if it takes a decade or two to get there. Bitcoin has clearly passed the proof of concept stage, and unless something catastrophic happens, it'll continue to exist for the rest of our lifetimes. The longer it survives, the more faith people will have in it as a store of value, a dynamic that should continue to see its value converge with that of gold.\nRelated to the store of value thesis, Bitcoin is also a great buy today if you're worried about economic uncertainty. Whether your concerns relate to geopolitical events, inflation, climatic shifts, or something else, Bitcoin can be a safe haven for your funds. The cryptocurrency is not controlled by any nation state, although they do have some ability to regulate its use. While the number of Bitcoins continues to increase, this inflation rate is set to diminish over time. At some point, zero new Bitcoins will be created -- a dream scenario for those looking for inflation-protected assets.\nWhether you see Bitcoin's value converging with gold's value, or if you like the cryptocurrency simply as a hedge to global volatility, there remain plenty of attractive reasons to keep a slice of your portfolio exposed to the most popular cryptocurrency of all time. But what is the best way to buy into Bitcoin? Three main options are discussed below.\nMany will argue that the best way to buy Bitcoin is by buying it directly yourself, storing the keys to your wealth with a digital wallet or a hardware wallet. This is a great option for those who know what they're doing -- but there are easier options for novices.\nFor example, you can always buy Bitcoin through a centralized exchange like Coinbase. You won't have full custody over your funds, but your Bitcoins will be relatively safe -- not to mention easier to manage at tax time, since most exchanges have tools that make the process easier. An even easier route is to buy a Bitcoin ETF, of which there are many.\nAll three of these options have advantages and disadvantages. But one should work well for your needs. Even if you're investing just a small amount to start, Bitcoin remains a powerful long-term investment for patient investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

The Answer Might Surprise You. was originally published by The Motley Fool","Many investors wonder “will 1 bitcoin be enough” to secure their financial future in 2024 and beyond. Bitcoin’s price has already hit $73,000 in March 2024, showing its growing strength in the market.\nThis guide breaks down expert predictions, market trends, and smart investment strategies to help you make informed choices about Bitcoin holdings. Get ready for a deep look at what top analysts say about Bitcoin’s future value.\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000 in late 2021, but market swings have kept traders on their toes since then. The spot Bitcoin ETF approval in early 2024 sparked fresh interest from Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, pushing prices above $45,000.\nBitcoin smashed through price records in 2024, reaching an eye-popping $93,000 by November. Market sentiment soared as big players like BlackRock jumped into the crypto space.\nTheir iShares Bitcoin Trust pulled in $13.9 billion from eager investors since January 2024. The rising inflation rates and spot ETF approvals pushed prices higher than ever before.\nGlobal ETF inflows hit $12.1 billion in just the first three months of 2024. The price kept climbing until it touched $99,655 on November 22, 2024. Institutional investors poured money into crypto assets as traditional financial markets looked shaky.\nThe growing adoption by major firms and clear rules from regulators helped drive this massive price surge.\nThe crypto market saw wild swings in recent years, with digital assets reaching new heights. Market data shows the peak price hit $68,789 on November 10, 2021, marking a major milestone for crypto traders.\nThis surge came from growing institutional interest and mainstream adoption. Major companies like Tesla jumped in, driving prices up. The market also felt the effects of global events, interest rates, and changing regulations.\nPrice shifts created both winners and losers in the trading space.\nMarket experts point to several key factors behind these dramatic moves. Institutional money flowed into crypto through new investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs sparked fresh interest from Wall Street players.\nThe collapse of exchanges like FTX shook market confidence at times. Still, technical analysis suggests strong support levels held up. Price forecasts remain bullish, with predictions showing a minimum of $97,462.55 by December 2024.\nLooking at these trends helps us understand what drives future price action. Let’s explore what top analysts predict for Bitcoin’s value in the coming years.\nBitcoin’s price could hit $250,000 by 2025, with major Wall Street firms jumping into crypto ETFs and driving demand sky-high. Market experts point to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 as a key catalyst that might spark another massive bull run, similar to previous cycles.\nMarket experts have shared bold predictions for Bitcoin’s value in 2025. Top analysts point to several key factors that could push prices to new heights.\nLooking ahead from 2025, Bitcoin’s path shows even bolder price targets. Top analysts and financial giants have shared their thoughts about Bitcoin’s value in 2030.\nMarket experts predict massive gains for Bitcoin in the next few decades. Their forecasts point to life-changing wealth for early investors who hold through 2050.\nBitcoin’s price swings like a pendulum, based on countless market forces. Global events, trader emotions, and government rules push the price up or down every single day.\nMarket sentiment shows strong bullish signals for Bitcoin in late 2024. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 94 out of 100, pointing to extreme market optimism. Social media buzz and trading patterns reveal that 84% of traders expect higher BTC prices ahead.\nUnlike physical Bitcoins, market sentiment drives real price action through spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $4.6 billion in first-day trading volume.\nMarket sentiment is like a tide – it lifts all boats during euphoria and grounds them during fear. – Peter Brandt\nTraders now use technical tools like the Relative Strength Index and Bollinger Bands to track market mood swings. Day traders watch these signals closely to time their entries and exits.\nThe high trading volume shows strong institutional adoption, with more players entering through ETF products. Simple moving averages help spot trends in this volatile market.\nBitcoin’s value moves up and down based on big economic shifts. J.P. Morgan’s team points to Bitcoin as a safe spot during tough money times, like high inflation rates and central bank decisions.\nThe U.S. dollar’s strength, interest rates, and global trade tensions push Bitcoin prices around like a boat on rough waters. I’ve watched these patterns play out in my own trading since 2017.\nThe U.S. elections and world politics shake up Bitcoin prices, too. Monetary policies from big banks create waves in crypto markets. These factors hit harder than most people think.\nThe next big shift might come from new rules about crypto trading and exchange-traded funds. Political changes could bring fresh challenges for Bitcoin investors.\nThe U.S. crypto landscape changed big time in January 2024. The SEC gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, making waves across the market. This move sparked fresh confidence among institutional investors and opened new doors for mainstream adoption.\nThe regulatory shift marked a stark difference from past years of strict oversight and unclear rules.\nDonald Trump’s re-election brought another game-changing development to the crypto space. His bold proposal for a U.S. national Bitcoin reserve signals a major shift in government stance.\nThe favorable regulatory environment in 2024 has pushed more traditional finance players into the crypto market. Wall Street giants now view Bitcoin as a serious asset class, not just a speculative bet.\nThese changes point to growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the American financial system.\nBitcoin halving stands as a key event in crypto history, cutting mining rewards in half every four years. Past halvings sparked massive price jumps – after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin soared from $11 to $1,100.\nMarket sentiment shifted even more dramatically during the 2016 halving, pushing prices from $650 to a peak of $20,000 in 2017. Most recently, the 2020 halving led to an eight-fold increase, with Bitcoin climbing from $8,000 to $64,000.\nMining rewards dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC during the 2024 halving, with prices hovering near $61,000. These scheduled supply cuts create scarcity and often trigger bullish market cycles.\nSmart investors track these events closely since they impact Bitcoin’s inflation rate and price movements. Past data shows that halvings tend to spark major rallies in the following 12–18 months.\nBitcoin’s future could swing between two major paths by 2024. Some experts see it becoming digital gold worth $500,000, while others predict it will replace regular money for daily shopping and bill payments.\nMany experts now view digital assets as the next frontier for wealth storage. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made waves by calling Bitcoin “digital gold,” sparking fresh interest from Wall Street veterans.\nMajor financial players see Bitcoin as a shield against rising prices, much like precious metals served past generations. The virtual coin stands out for its fixed supply of 21 million tokens, making it resistant to the money-printing habits of central banks.\nSmart money keeps flowing into Bitcoin as an inflation hedge during tough economic times. The coin’s price moves opposite to inflation rates, proving its worth as a safety net. Big banks and investment firms now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries, treating it like gold bars in a digital vault.\nThis shift marks a clear change from the early days when only tech fans bought the asset.\nBitcoin serves as a powerful medium of exchange across borders. Major companies like PayPal have embraced Bitcoin payments, making daily transactions smoother for users worldwide. The network processes thousands of transactions every hour, letting people buy coffee, book flights, or send money to family overseas.\nThis shift marks a big change in how we think about money and payments.\nThe crypto exchange landscape keeps growing stronger for Bitcoin transactions. More stores now accept Bitcoin through digital wallets, making it as easy as swiping a credit card. Tesla’s move to recognize Bitcoin pushed other businesses to follow suit.\nSmall fees and quick settlement times give Bitcoin an edge over traditional banking systems. Local shops to global retailers now see Bitcoin as a practical way to handle everyday purchases.\nMany experts believe one Bitcoin could fund a comfortable retirement by 2040, thanks to its growing role as an inflation shield. Your retirement success with Bitcoin depends on your entry price, holding period, and how the crypto market grows against traditional pension plans.\nBitcoin stands as a shield against inflation in today’s money-printing world. Smart investors now put 5% of their wealth into Bitcoin to protect their money’s value. The U.S. dollar keeps losing power as the government prints more cash and piles up debt.\nBitcoin fights back because no one can make more of it at will – its supply stays fixed at 21 million coins forever.\nBitcoin’s inflation-fighting power comes from its strict supply rules built into its code. Unlike dollars that flow endlessly from government printers, Bitcoin follows a clear path.\nBig players know this truth – that’s why investment firms pour billions into Bitcoin rather than watch their dollars shrink. The math is simple: as dollars get weaker, Bitcoin grows stronger as a store of value.\nExperts predict a bright future for digital assets in retirement portfolios through 2024 and beyond. Market data shows 95% of current holders plan to buy more coins, signaling strong faith in long-term growth.\nProfessional investors point to rising inflation rates and economic shifts as key drivers pushing more people toward crypto investments. Many financial advisors now suggest a small portion of retirement savings in digital currencies to balance traditional assets.\nSmart money sees digital currencies as a hedge against money printing and bank failures. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank pushed more investors to look at decentralized options.\nNearly half of people who don’t own crypto say they’ll likely buy some in 2024, showing growing mainstream interest. Technical analysis suggests upward price movement after the next halving event, making now a strategic time for long-term positions.\nTop investment firms like Fidelity project major value increases by 2040, backed by institutional adoption and ETF approvals.\nBitcoin stands apart from stocks and gold through its wild price swings and massive growth potential. Smart investors track how Bitcoin moves against the S&P 500 and gold prices to spot fresh chances for profits.\nThe age-old battle between digital and physical assets takes an interesting turn in 2024. Gold’s impressive run to $2,787 and Bitcoin’s post-election surge have investors scratching their heads.\nBoth stocks and Bitcoin offer different paths to wealth creation, but they come with distinct characteristics worth comparing.\nBitcoin’s wild price swings can wipe out half your money in a single day, making it a nerve-wracking ride for new investors. Security breaches at crypto exchanges and changing government rules add extra layers of risk that could impact your Bitcoin investment.\nMarket swings hit crypto traders hard in 2022, with price drops reaching a steep 76.9% during the bear market. Sharp price moves happen fast in crypto markets, making spot bitcoin ETFs and futures trading extra risky.\nMany traders lose money trying to time these wild price swings. Market sentiment shifts quickly based on news about regulations, institutional investors, or major exchange issues.\nPrice stability remains a key challenge for widespread bitcoin adoption. Technical analysis tools help track market trends, but they can’t predict sudden crashes or rallies. Smart traders use dollar-cost averaging to reduce their risk during volatile periods.\nThey also keep their positions small and avoid using leverage, which can lead to bigger losses when prices move against them. The crypto market’s high-frequency traders and arbitrage bots add to this price chaos daily.\nGovernment rules on Bitcoin change fast across different countries. Some nations welcome crypto with open arms, while others slam their doors shut. The SEC’s tough stance on crypto trading has shaken up U.S. markets lately.\nMany Bitcoin investors lost money in 2023 due to unclear rules and sudden policy changes. I’ve seen firsthand how these shifts can impact portfolios – my own Bitcoin investments faced uncertainty during the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank.\nBig players like institutional investors watch these regulatory moves closely. The lack of clear frameworks makes Bitcoin price swings bigger and harder to predict. Countries could ban Bitcoin tomorrow, or tax it heavily next month.\nSmart investors keep cash ready for these sudden changes. The next section explores key technology risks that could affect your Bitcoin investment.\nBitcoin’s tech limits create real safety risks for investors. The network can only handle 6-8 transactions per second, which leads to slow processing times during high traffic. Hackers target Bitcoin holders through ransomware attacks and fake investment schemes.\nMany people lose their coins by mismanaging private keys or falling for scams on social media platforms.\nSecurity threats pop up daily in the crypto space. Decentralized finance apps face constant attacks from bad actors looking to steal funds. Smart investors use hardware wallets and two-factor authentication to protect their Bitcoin.\nThey also avoid clicking suspicious links or sharing private key details with anyone. Market volatility adds another layer of risk, as sudden price drops can catch even careful traders off guard.\nSmart Bitcoin investors know timing isn’t everything – they build wealth through steady, planned moves in both bull and bear markets. Your path to Bitcoin success starts with proven methods like spreading out your buys and keeping some cash ready for market dips.\nDollar-cost averaging cuts through Bitcoin’s wild price swings like a hot knife through butter. I’ve seen countless investors panic-sell during dips, but this strategy keeps emotions in check.\nBy investing fixed amounts at set times, you’ll grab Bitcoin at various price points – both high and low. Take the real example of putting in $50,000 during price swings, which landed 1.4 Bitcoin at an average cost of $40,000 each.\nThis method turns market volatility into your friend.\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and proven track record in both crypto and traditional markets. Market sentiment shifts don’t matter as much when you stick to a regular buying schedule.\nMy personal experience shows this works well with Bitcoin’s inflation hedge properties. The strategy helps build positions steadily while managing risks from price fluctuations and bearish outlooks.\nPlus, it fits perfectly with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles, letting you accumulate more coins before each supply reduction event.\nMarket cycles test every Bitcoin investor’s nerves. Smart investors stay calm during price swings and focus on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. The recent 5.72x price increase since the last cycle low proves this strategy works.\nHolding Bitcoin through ups and downs beats trying to time the market perfectly.\nBitcoin’s fourth halving in April 2024 marks another key moment for long-term holders. The block reward dropped from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins, making each coin more scarce. Strong hands who grip their coins through market volatility often see better results than those who panic sell.\nThink of it like riding waves – sometimes you need to stay on your surfboard even when the water gets rough.\nSmart investors spread their money across different assets to protect their wealth. Ethereum stands out as a top choice next to Bitcoin, offering strong growth potential in the crypto space.\nCFDs give traders another way to profit from price swings without owning actual coins. I’ve learned through years of trading that mixing traditional investments with crypto helps smooth out the bumpy ride.\nA balanced portfolio needs more than just digital coins to thrive. Gold serves as a time-tested hedge against inflation, while stocks offer steady growth over time. My portfolio gained stability once I added these different pieces to the puzzle.\nThe mix of assets helped me stay calm during crypto winters and market storms. Statistical arbitrage between these various investments creates extra profit chances while cutting down overall risk.\nLeading crypto experts predict Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030, with major players like Fidelity backing these bold forecasts – read on to discover why these predictions might just come true.\nBitcoin experts have set bold price targets for the coming years. Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader known for his technical analysis, sees Bitcoin reaching $120,000 to $200,000 by September 2025.\nHis forecast stems from market sentiment and historical price patterns. Max Keiser, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, takes an even more bullish stance. He predicts Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2024 and surge to $1 million by 2040.\nThese price targets reflect growing institutional adoption and inflationary pressures in the global economy. Both experts point to Bitcoin’s fixed supply and increasing demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs as key drivers.\nTheir predictions align with the broader market view of Bitcoin as a store of value. I’ve tracked these forecasts closely since 2020, and they match the upward trend we’ve seen in institutional investment flows.\nHal Finney, an early Bitcoin pioneer, made a bold prediction that shook the cryptocurrency market. His famous thought experiment suggested one Bitcoin could reach $10 million if it became the world’s main payment system.\nAs a respected computer scientist and the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto, Finney’s analysis carried serious weight in the digital coin price discussions.\nThe math behind Finney’s prediction focused on Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and medium of exchange. He looked at the total value of all money worldwide and divided it by the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins.\nHis calculation pointed to massive price targets that seemed wild at the time. Now, let’s see what Fidelity, a major institutional investor, thinks about Bitcoin’s future value.\nFidelity Investments dropped a bombshell with their Bitcoin price forecast. Their analysts predict one Bitcoin could hit $1 billion by 2038, two years ahead of 2040. This bold projection stems from Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value and its fixed supply of 21 million coins.\nMarket sentiment points to increased institutional adoption as a key driver.\nTop financial minds at Fidelity base this target on several market dynamics. They factor in Bitcoin’s halving events, which cut mining rewards in half every four years. The team also considers rising inflationary pressures on traditional currencies.\nTheir model suggests Bitcoin will grab a bigger slice of the global financial pie, especially as more institutional investors jump in through spot ETFs and direct holdings.\nMarket sentiment and bitcoin price forecasts suggest strong growth due to spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption. The upcoming bitcoin halving and growing interest from institutional investors point to rising values. Plus, with inflation hedge benefits, one BTC might serve as a solid store of value.\nInterest rates, inflationary pressures, and central banking system decisions shape Bitcoin’s exchange rate. Market dynamics and technical analysis show that quantitative easing impacts cryptocurrency prices. The medium of exchange role keeps growing stronger.\nWhile some say Bitcoin is overvalued, Elliott Wave patterns and mean reversion suggest otherwise. The genesis block started a revolution that’s now backed by institutional investors. Smart diversification and careful intraday trading can help manage risks.\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) and products like GBTC are changing how people invest in Bitcoin. These leveraged products make it easier for traditional investors to join the cryptocurrency market without dealing with the underlying asset directly.\nBitcoin leads the cryptocurrency market dynamics with stronger institutional adoption than altcoins. While speculation drives many initial coin offerings (ICOs), Bitcoin maintains its position as the primary digital coin price benchmark.\nCryptocurrency regulation affects market sentiments and bullish sentiment. CFD trading and contracts for difference might face new rules, but Bitcoin’s core value proposition remains strong. The Mt. Gox situation taught us the importance of proper oversight.\nhttps:\/\/m.economictimes.com\/markets\/cryptocurrency\/can-bitcoin-surpass-the-100k-mark-in-2024\/articleshow\/115200981.cms (2024-11-12)\nhttps:\/\/capital.com\/bitcoin-price-prediction-2030-2050\nhttps:\/\/www.swanbitcoin.com\/economics\/bitcoin-price-prediction\/\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/380755044_US_macroeconomic_determinants_of_Bitcoin (2024-10-22)\nhttps:\/\/www.otdowntown.com\/sponsored-content\/factors-that-will-influence-the-price-of-bitcoin-in-2024-NL3519197 (2024-07-23)\nhttps:\/\/b2binpay.com\/en\/bitcoin-in-2024-unveiling-the-future-of-crypto-with-historical-insights-and-forecasts\/ (2024-09-26)\nhttps:\/\/www.blockpit.io\/en-us\/blog\/bitcoin-halving\nhttps:\/\/www.fidelitydigitalassets.com\/sites\/g\/files\/djuvja3256\/files\/acquiadam\/1125481.2.0%20-%20FDA%20Bitcoin%20as%20an%20Aspirational%20Store%20of%20Value%20Revisited%20V2.pdf\nhttps:\/\/www.unbiased.co.uk\/discover\/personal-finance\/savings-investing\/the-future-of-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-2022-and-beyond (2024-09-18)\nhttps:\/\/www.simplilearn.com\/crypto-predictions-article\nhttps:\/\/kavinoky.com\/2024\/08\/bitcoin-hedge-against-inflation-institutional-investors\/ (2024-08-16)\nhttps:\/\/401kspecialistmag.com\/2024-likely-to-see-rise-in-allocation-to-retirement-accounts-study\/ (2023-11-30)\nhttps:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/article\/should-you-invest-in-bitcoin-151647017.html\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/professional\/insights\/commodities\/bitcoin-versus-gold-the-heavyweights-duel\/ (2024-11-22)\nhttps:\/\/www.wisdomtree.com\/investments\/-\/media\/us-media-files\/documents\/resource-library\/market-insights\/gannatti-commentary\/bitcoin-correlations.pdf\nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2024\/08\/08\/bitcoins-volatility-makes-it-a-risky-investment-experts-say.html\nhttps:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-024-03908-3\nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/tech\/what-will-happen-bitcoin-next-decade\/\nhttps:\/\/bitpay.com\/blog\/dollar-cost-averaging-crypto\/\nhttps:\/\/www.ark-invest.com\/articles\/analyst-research\/bitcoin-cycles-entering-2025 (2024-11-15)\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/341805173_Bitcoin_and_Portfolio_Diversification_A_Portfolio_Optimization_Approach (2024-11-21)\nhttps:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/business\/legendary-trader-peter-brandt-predicts-230-bitcoin-price-increase (2024-05-31)\nhttps:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/hal-finneys-epic-bitcoin-price-prediction-from-2009-heres-why-10-million-btc-is-possible-3757606\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/coinmonks\/fidelity-predicts-1-billion-bitcoin-db635f226195\nORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON\nDecember 11, 2024\nin\nPower & Money\nHosting a Formal NYE Party?

And investors are turning to bitcoin ETFs to cash in on the cryptocurrency's run.\nShares of the largest of these ETFs are up an average 114% since February — the first full month most of the funds had been trading. But while it's tempting to treat all the bitcoin ETFs the same, as they're all basically tracking the same asset, they have important distinctions.\nOne futures-based ETF, ProShares Bitcoin (BITO), even yields 52.3%. That's a big difference from most of the spot-price bitcoin ETFs that yield nothing. But it's another reminder of how investors are still looking for the best ways to play cryptocurrency.\n\"We believe many advisors and investors that have access to bitcoin via ETFs do so as a small low-single-digit percentage of the portfolio in a risk-on manner,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at TMX Vetta Fi. \"However many people have remained on the sidelines perhaps waiting for a better entry point or a way to access without the same volatility.\"\nWhich such ETFs are winning over the most investors during this year's boom?\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as the big victor. It's now the largest, by far, with $51.1 billion in assets, says ETFDB.com.\nBut Fidelity is making a solid run, too. Its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) grabbed roughly $20 billion in assets. Both the Fidelity and iShares Bitcoin ETFs are up 138% this year since February. That tops the 113% gain by the $20 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\nGrayscale Bitcoin, though, converted its preexisting futures-based trust into a spot price-based ETF. As a result, it paid a yield of 7.7%.\nMost investors prefer the spot-price ETFs. But use of futures contracts has its perk: Sky-high yields.\nThe ProShares Bitcoin ETF's 52% yield is the best example. \"For tax purposes, each fund recognizes any net income of its subsidiary, including gains on such futures contracts or swap agreements in which its subsidiary invests, as an ordinary dividend on the final day of the subsidiary's tax year,\" says ProShares' website.\nBut that yield may not be an asset. It comes at a price. Rather than being up 138% since February like the spot-price bitcoin ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin is up just 28%. Keep in mind, too, the dividends may trigger a taxable event for some investors.\n\"Bitcoin futures based ETFs have moved out of focus for many investors,\" Rosenbluth said. \"They were initially the best way to access the price of bitcoin in ETF wrapper. However BITO has seen net outflows since the middle of January.\"\nFollowing the iShares and Fidelity funds, the ETFs drop off fast. Even ARK Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) lured less than $5 billion in assets. VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) drew in barely more than $1 billion. And those are still big enough to be considered successful. Franklin Bitcoin (EZBC) lured less than $800 million.\n\"A strong ETF brand with broader distribution has helped in a crowded market,\" Rosenbluth said.\nFollow Matt Krantz on X (Twitter) @mattkrantz\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nNvidia Owns 4 Stocks — One Is Doing Even Better Than It Is\nVanguard Is Paying 4.7% Risk-Free — But Only If You Do This\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\nFind Today's Best Growth Stocks To Watch With IBD 50\nJoin IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The Open\nGet instant access to exclusive stock lists, expert market analysis and powerful tools with 2 months of IBD Digital for only $20!\nGet market updates, educational videos, webinars, and stock analysis.\nLearn how you can make more money with IBD's investing tools, top-performing stock lists, and educational content.","VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, is excited to announce the listing of HoldCoin (HOLDCOIN) on its spot market with the trading pair HOLDCOIN\/USDT.

The firm projects Bitcoin to hit a\nstaggering $180,000, while Ethereum could surpass $6,000. Other prominent\ncryptocurrencies like Solana and Sui are anticipated to reach $500 and $10\nrespectively, showcasing the breadth of the projected rally.\n“Following\nthis first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing\nsharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer,” VanEck’s\nMatthew Sigel forecasted. “However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with\nmajor tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the\nend of the year.”\nTo identify\npotential market tops, VanEck has outlined several key indicators they're\nclosely monitoring. These include sustained high funding rates in futures\nmarkets, excessive unrealized profits among Bitcoin holders, overvalued market\ncapitalization relative to realized value, declining Bitcoin market dominance,\nand signs of mainstream speculative fervor.\nMore\ninterestingly, those are not the highest Bitcoin price forecasts for 2025.\nAs Bitcoin tested\nlevels above $106,000, leading industry figures have set their sights on\nambitious targets for 2025. Here are the most notable predictions focusing\nspecifically on next year:\nTom Lee says #Bitcoin is going to $250,000 in one year 🚀 pic.twitter.com\/JNzCd0yadu\nBitcoin's\nrecent surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors that have\nsignificantly bolstered investor confidence. President-elect Donald Trump's\nannouncement of plans to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve has been a\nmajor catalyst, signaling a dramatic shift in the governmental approach to\ncryptocurrencies. This, coupled with the inclusion of MicroStrategy, a major\ncorporate Bitcoin holder, in the prestigious Nasdaq 100 index, has underscored\ngrowing institutional acceptance.\nLooking\nahead to 2025, industry experts and analysts have put forth a range of bullish\npredictions for Bitcoin's value. Venture capitalist Tim Draper maintains his\nforecast of $250,000 by the end of 2025, while Standard Chartered Bank projects\na target of $200,000. Investment firm VanEck offers a more nuanced outlook,\nsuggesting Bitcoin could reach $180,000 in early 2025 before experiencing a\ncorrection and subsequent recovery.\nAs for\nBitcoin's prospects in 2024, the outlook remains optimistic based on current\nmarket dynamics and recent developments. With Bitcoin currently trading above\n$100,000, many analysts view $110,000 as the next immediate target. Bitcoin\nmaximalist Max Keiser has made a bold prediction of $220,000 by the end of\n2024. The implementation of Trump's strategic reserve plan, if it comes to\nfruition, could provide additional upward momentum.\nShare this article","Bitcoin’s price rallied almost 5% over the weekend to set a new all-time high above $106,000 amid speculation that it may become a United States reserve asset.\nCK Zheng, chief investment officer of ZK Square, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has likely entered “Santa Claus mode,” as many investors fear missing out and look to allocate more capital into the asset class.\nHe predicted a Bitcoin price tag of $125,000 in early 2025 but warned a possible 30% correction could follow as most of the bullish news from the incoming Trump administration has been “priced in.”\nA 30% correction from $125,000 would see Bitcoin retrace to around $87,500.\nFrom a liquidity perspective, we should not be surprised that bitcoin continues to charge higher (but the new year may bring some weakness)...\nBitcoin has also reached a new record relative to gold (1 BTC can now buy 40 oz of gold).\nGracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, writes that while the Santa Claus rally is a well-documented phenomenon in traditional stock markets, its presence in cryptocurrency is less clear.\nCryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and 24\/7 trading, don’t always follow equities’ seasonal patterns. A second trend can be applied to this model that has empirically proven a powerful predictor of a Santa Claus rally occurring in Cryptoland: whether or not the market is in a bull run.\nIt’s safe to say that crypto firmly checks that box right now, thus making a compelling case for a severe rally coming together as the year draws close. In late 2017, for example, BTC rallied by 68% over the two weeks spanning the New Year. Subsequent years have been more muted, in line with the prevailing market mood at the time. But then there’s 2024, which has already broken all crypto records. One wouldn’t bet against it closing out the year on a tear just to complete the clean sweep.\nIf traders buy into the Santa Claus rally thesis, they don’t need to create a prediction market to speculate on the likelihood — although nothing is stopping them. In crypto, financial freedom comes as a standard. A more intelligent strategy is filling one’s conviction bags before the year-end. Load up on the assets you believe in the most, and then sit back and let the prophecy unfold.\nAs 2024 closes out, the financial landscape presents a mix of optimism and caution. The global economy has shown resilience, with many sectors rebounding from previous downturns. Consumer spending during the holiday season is expected to be robust, bolstering market sentiment. The only potential dampener could be the escalation of global tensions in the Middle East or Ukraine. Still, barring a major macro event, there’s every reason to expect the current bull market to remain intact.\nEven if the Santa Claus rally proves to be a damp squib on this occasion, it’s no biggie: The bags investors have accumulated now are likely to stand them in good stead next year as the crypto market continues to grind higher. They don’t have to leave a glass of milk and some cookies out, but there’s no excuse for not being ready for Santa this Christmas.\nIt comes as Strike founder and CEO Jack Mallers said US President-Elect Donald Trump could potentially issue an executive order designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset on his first day in office on Jan. 20.\n“There’s potential to use a day-one executive order to purchase Bitcoin,” Mallers stated, adding:\n“It wouldn't be the size and scale of 1 million coins but it would be a significant position.\"\nMeanwhile, Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said a third Bitcoin reserve bill is in the works at the state level, though he didn’t say which state might follow Texas and Pennsylvania’s lead.\n“We had Pennsylvania, and we had Texas. And now we have another state coming on board. And they sent me the draft. So I know it’s real,” he said during a Dec. 15 X Spaces.\nPorter added he expects at least 10 states to introduce a Bitcoin reserve bill in total.\n\"Its not going to stop. We're going to see more and more of these bills come. At least 10, in my opinion.\"\nFinancial analysts are also tipping a 0.25% interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve on Dec. 18, which could lift Bitcoin’s price even further in the coming months.Another catalyst behind Bitcoin’s price surge may be one of the new rules by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which enables institutions to record the value of their crypto assets more realistically. The rule will apply to fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15.\nHowever, bitcoin’s market sentiment is currently in the “Extreme Greed” zone at a score of 83 out of 100, according to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index.\nCrypto Fear and Greed Index score for Dec. 16.

Crypto trading, in particular, stands out for its 24\/7 markets, high volatility, and endless opportunities.\nBut stepping into trading can feel overwhelming. With countless strategies, complex charts, and unique terms, it’s easy to get lost. This guide simplifies everything, helping you understand the foundations: what trading is, how to use indicators, and how to develop actionable strategies tailored to cryptocurrency markets.\nLet’s break it down step-by-step to build your confidence as a trader.\nAt its heart, trading is the act of buying and selling assets such as cryptocurrencies, with the aim of making a profit. Unlike long-term investing (HODLing), where you hold assets for years, trading focuses on short-term price movements.\n1. Opportunities for Wealth Growth: Crypto’s volatility creates frequent opportunities for profits.2. Freedom and Flexibility: Trade anywhere, anytime, thanks to global 24\/7 markets.3. Active Participation: Engage deeply with financial systems, market trends, and strategies.\nBefore placing your first trade, it’s critical to choose a trading style that fits your goals and lifestyle.\n1. Day Trading- What it is: Buying and selling within the same day to profit from small price movements.- Best for: Traders who can dedicate time to monitor markets closely and handle fast-paced decisions.- Example: Buying Bitcoin at $97,000 in the morning and selling it at $107,300 by evening.- Risk Level: High\n2. Swing Trading- What it is: Holding assets for days or weeks to profit from price “swings.” - Best for: Those with limited time but strong analysis skills for medium-term trends.- Example: Buying Ethereum at $3,700 after a breakout and holding until it peaks at $4,000.- Risk Level: Medium\n3. Position Trading- What it is: Long-term trading, focusing on major trends and market cycles.- Best for: Those who prefer minimal trades and have patience for long-term growth.- Example: Buying Bitcoin at $80,000 during a dip and holding it until it hits $95,000 months later.- Risk Level: Low\n4. Scalping- What it is: Executing rapid trades within minutes to capture tiny price changes.- Best for: Experienced traders comfortable with stress and high trading fees.- Risk Level: Very High\n5. Crypto-Specific Trading- What it is: Trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or altcoins in 24\/7 markets.- Best for: Traders who thrive in volatile markets and enjoy leveraging crypto-specific metrics.\nTip: Use tools like Binance Academy or CoinGecko to research each trading style further.\nUnderstanding the language of trading is just as important as knowing when to buy or sell. Here are the basics:\n- Market Order: Execute a trade at the current price immediately.- Limit Order: Set a price at which you want to buy or sell.- Bid\/Ask Price: Bid is what buyers are willing to pay, and Ask is what sellers are asking.- Spread: The difference between the bid and ask prices.- Liquidity: How easily an asset can be bought\/sold without affecting its price - Support\/Resistance Levels: Key price points where assets tend to reverse direction.- Bull\/Bear Market: Bull = rising prices; Bear = falling prices.- Stop-Loss Order: Automatically exit a trade to limit losses.\nUnderstanding these terms makes navigating the market much smoother.\nIndicators simplify trading decisions by analyzing market patterns. Here are the most essential ones for beginners:\n1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)- Purpose: Measures whether an asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).- How to Use: RSI < 30 signals potential buying opportunities; RSI > 70 suggests selling.- Pro Tip: Combine RSI with support\/resistance levels for better accuracy.\n2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)- Purpose: Shows the strength and direction of trends. - How to Use: Look for crossovers between the MACD and signal lines to confirm trends.\n3. Bollinger Bands- Purpose: Tracks price volatility using upper and lower bands. - How to Use: Tight bands indicate low volatility (possible breakout), while price touching the bands signals overbought\/oversold conditions.\n4. Moving Average (MA)- Purpose: Smooths out price trends by averaging past prices. - How to Use: Look for “golden cross” (bullish) and “death cross” (bearish) patterns by comparing short- and long-term MAs.\n5. Volume - Purpose: Measures the number of assets being traded.- How to Use: A price breakout with high volume indicates strength; low volume suggests uncertainty.\nCrypto markets offer unique metrics that provide deeper insights into price movements:\n1. On-Chain Activity: - Use tools like Glassnode to track wallet transactions, staking activity, and token movements. - Why it matters: High activity often signals sentiment shifts.\n2. Market Sentiment: - Platforms like the Fear & Greed Index gauge overall market psychology. - Why it matters: Sentiment can foreshadow price movements.\n3. Token Supply Dynamics: - Track circulating supply and burn rates (e.g., Ethereum burns post-EIP-1559).  - Why it matters: Shrinking supply can drive price increases.\nA step-by-step approach to identify trading opportunities:\n1. Setup: - RSI < 30 indicates oversold conditions. - MACD confirms momentum. - Bollinger Bands signal a possible breakout.\n2. Validate: - Check trading volume for strength. - Use on-chain data (e.g., wallet activity) for additional confirmation.\n3. Execute: - Place your trade and set stop-loss and take-profit levels.\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/N1w_6G6fn2A?si=Zjq4_rmp1D1cFXjy\nTip: Test your strategy using a demo account on platforms like Binance before risking real funds.\n1. FOMO Trading: Avoid trades driven by hype without analysis. 2. Over-Leveraging: Borrowing funds amplifies both gains and losses. 3. Emotional Trading: Greed and fear often lead to bad decisions. 4. Ignoring Stop-Losses: Never leave your trades unprotected. 5. Skipping Research: Use resources like Messari to stay informed.\n1. Charting Platforms: - TradingView: Best for technical analysis.\n2. Market Data: - CoinMarketCap: Real-time prices and rankings.\n3. On-Chain Analysis: - CryptoQuant: Wallet activity and market flows.\n4. Portfolio Management: - Use CoinTracking to track and analyze your trades.\nCrypto trading offers endless opportunities, but success requires discipline, strategy, and continuous learning. Master the basics, combine indicators with crypto-specific metrics, and always manage your risks.\nTrading is a journey—start small, refine your approach, and grow over time. What’s your first trade?

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\nBitcoin has experienced significant price movements in the past few days, largely influenced by macroeconomic developments and market fundamentals.\nFollowing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000.\nHowever, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation.\nAmid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes.\nAccording to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021.\nHowever, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years.\nThis decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term.\nMarket intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500.\nThis accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction.\nIt is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts.\nMeanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\nThis level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal.\nWolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either.\n📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking.

A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others.\nEdyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis.\nBefore becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics.\nWhen he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…)\nWell, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life.\nIn a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps.\nEdyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.”\nPS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp.\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly.

Overlays of rainbow color bands on top of the LGC suggest market sentiment at different price ranges.\n“Bitcoin rainbow chart shows some beautiful things. First of all, the previous top should have been way higher as it didn’t get into extreme territory. Secondly, the longer the chart lasts, the higher the tops will be. If we get a bull to 2026, a target of $500,000 isn’t bad.”\nNext up, the analyst suggests Bitcoin has likely hit its near-term peak already due to the hawkish outlook announced this week by the Fed. However, he says altcoins may start to rip.\n“When it comes to the Bitcoin price action, I think we’ve sealed the high for now. The good part: altcoins are ready to fire off when the labor market data is going to be worse, as that’s going to provide a substantial correction on the Yields. Finally, the chances of a longer cycle for crypto have significantly increased.”\nLastly, he predicts that the crypto bull market is far from over.\n“Altcoins are dead. That’s what you hear. Let me tell you: they are not. This cycle isn’t. There’s so much more to come, but this cycle will be full of surprises.

The total market capitalization has decreased to $3.3 trillion,\nmarking the lowest level in nearly a month. This decline triggered\napproximately $1.5 billion in liquidations across the crypto market.\nBitcoin's decline is attributed to multiple factors: the\nFederal Reserve's hawkish stance on interest rates, fears of a\nslower-than-expected rate cut cycle in 2025, and pre-holiday low liquidity\nconditions. Market structure weaknesses and high leverage have also contributed\nto the downward pressure.\nXRP's decline aligns with the broader market downturn\nfollowing the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.

This milestone solidified Bitcoin’s standing as a cornerstone financial asset, driven by institutional demand, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory support.\nIBIT 6-Month Fund Flows Chart | Source: ETF.com\nBitcoin’s bullish breakout | Source: TradingView\nNumber of Active Addresses | Source: Glassnode\nInvestor sentiment turned bullish in December, with a marked shift toward “greed” as Bitcoin climbed past $100,000. However, caution emerged as:\nGold vs Bitcoin\nBitcoin’s milestone of surpassing $100,000 underscores its evolution from a speculative asset to a recognized financial instrument. While the rally reflects growing adoption and institutional interest, its sustainability hinges on a balance between regulatory developments, technological progress, and market dynamics. As 2025 approaches, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem is poised to grow further.\nKey global crypto regulatory updates\nThe cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in December 2024 witnessed significant strides globally, marked by pro-crypto policies, pivotal legal precedents, and increased institutional adoption. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted the growing acceptance of digital assets as a mainstream financial category.\nAs institutional players continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market, retail investors are grappling with a rapidly shifting landscape. AMBCrypto’s exclusive survey of 4,432 respondents provides deep insights into the dynamics between these two influential groups and their collective impact on the market in 2024.\nInstitutional investors clearly emerged as the dominant force in 2024, with 57.5% of respondents identifying them as the biggest influencers in the crypto market. Retail investors lagged significantly at 13.6%, while 28.9% believed both groups contributed equally to shaping trends.\nCrypto market trust and institutional concerns\nThe increasing involvement of institutions has fundamentally altered market perception. An overwhelming 64.8% of respondents stated that institutional presence significantly boosted trust, thanks to enhanced legitimacy and stability. In contrast, only 9.4% reported a decline in trust.\nHowever, the shift hasn’t come without concerns. 56.4% of respondents believe institutional dominance risks turning crypto into a clone of traditional finance, eroding its original ethos of decentralization.\nLiquidity gains vs. manipulation risks\nRespondents highlighted significant changes in market behavior due to institutional involvement:\nRetail investors’ resilience and market prediction\nThe survey revealed a mixed outlook on retail investors’ future:\nWhen asked about leadership in 2025, 49.4% predicted institutional dominance, while just 12.8% foresaw retail investors regaining influence.\nRegulations vs. innovation\nInstitutions are viewed as both enablers and potential barriers:\nAMBCrypto’s survey highlights the growing prominence of institutional players in the crypto market, reflecting their ability to bring trust and liquidity while raising questions about decentralization and fairness. As 2025 approaches, the balance between institutional and retail influence will be pivotal in defining the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies.\nEthereum’s trajectory in December 2024 reflected its adaptability and innovation, bolstered by performance metrics, staking growth, and ecosystem developments. As a cornerstone of the crypto industry, Ethereum remained pivotal in driving decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs forward, even as it prepared for major upcoming upgrades.\nEthereum’s market performance in December 2024\nStaked ETH | Source: beaconcha.in\nValidators | Source: beaconcha.in\nIn December 2024, Ethereum reaffirmed its role as a leader in blockchain innovation. From record-high staking levels to sustained DeFi and NFT activity, Ethereum’s ecosystem demonstrated resilience and adaptability. As it gears up for transformative upgrades in 2025, Ethereum’s future remains as bright as its December performance.\nIn December 2024, XRP distinguished itself as a leading altcoin, driven by significant developments and market dynamics. The launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and favorable regulatory news contributed to XRP’s prominence during this period.\nXRP’s price movements in December 2024 | Source: CoinMarketCap\nDecember 2024 was a pivotal month for XRP, highlighted by the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin and significant regulatory approvals. These developments have the potential to enhance XRP’s utility and adoption in the digital payments ecosystem.

Many analysts predict that Bitcoin is entering a long-term high-volatility phase. In such a dynamic market, simply holding spot positions may no longer yield consistent short-term profits. To help traders seize opportunities, BexBack Exchange has launched an irresistible set of offers: a 100% deposit bonus, a $50 welcome bonus for new users, and up to 100x leverage for cryptocurrency trading. With no KYC required and a platform that welcomes users from around the world, BexBack creates unparalleled profit potential for investors globally.\nWhat Is 100x Leverage and How Does It Work?\nSimply put, 100x leverage allows you to open larger trading positions with less capital. For example:\nSuppose the Bitcoin price is $90,000 that day, and you open a long contract with 1 BTC. After using 100x leverage, the transaction amount is equivalent to 100 BTC.\nOne day later, if the price rises to $99,000, your profit will be (99,000 - 90,000) * 100 BTC \/ 90,000 = 10 BTC, a yield of up to 1000%.\nWith BexBack's deposit bonus\nBexBack offers a 100% deposit bonus. If the initial investment is 2 BTC, the profit will increase to 10 BTC, and the return on investment will double to 2000%.\nNote: Although leveraged trading can magnify profits, you also need to be wary of liquidation risks.\nHow Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work?\nThe deposit bonus from BexBack cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger positions and increase potential profits.

This beginner’s guide will introduce you to the fundamentals of crypto trading. It offers essential tips and strategies for navigating this vibrant market. With over 20,000 cryptocurrencies available, grasping the basics, selecting the right coins, and crafting a robust trading strategy are critical for success.Entering crypto trading for beginners may seem overwhelming at first. Yet, with the proper knowledge and approach, anyone can embark on this journey. You can initiate trading with as little as $1. Various strategies, such as day trading, swing trading, and position trading, cater to different goals and risk tolerances. It’s vital to acknowledge that crypto trading carries risk, and there’s a possibility of financial loss. Thus, only invest what you can afford to lose.When selecting cryptocurrencies for investment, prioritize coins like Bitcoin known for their significant price appreciation and substantial investor interest. Focus on cryptocurrencies with robust functionality, such as network speed, scalability, transaction costs, efficiency, and developer interest. These attributes can attract further investment and adoption. Following crypto experts can offer valuable insights into existing and emerging cryptocurrencies, aiding in understanding market trends.Creating a solid cryptocurrency trading strategy is paramount for success. Techniques like dollar-cost averaging and reinvesting profits can help grow your portfolio over time while managing risk. Patience and discipline are crucial, as panicking and selling during market downturns can result in losses. With diligent research and effective risk management, crypto trading can be both enjoyable and potentially lucrative.\nIn recent years, cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, offering a novel approach to transactions and value storage. At their essence, cryptocurrencies are digital assets that function as a medium of exchange, leveraging blockchain technology for secure, decentralized transactions. To comprehend the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, grasping the underlying technology and key concepts is crucial.\nCryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that operate independently of central banks or governments. They utilize cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known. Since then, numerous other cryptocurrencies have emerged, such as Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and Tether (a stablecoin).Despite their potential, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets that can drop quickly on rumors. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced a significant price boom, leading to a surge in its value and increased mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies. This volatility, though, makes them riskier investments for new traders.\n🌐 Step 1: Visit the Official Airdrop Page.Dive into the action by heading to the official airdrop page, where all live events are waiting for you. Don’t miss out!📱 Step 2: Use Your Mobile WalletEligibility checks are mobile-exclusive! Grab your smartphone and ensure you’re using a mobile wallet to participate.💰 Step 3: Meet the Eligibility CriteriaMake sure your wallet isn’t empty or brand new — only active wallets qualify. If one doesn’t work, don’t worry! Try again with another wallet to secure your rewards.\nBlockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies, functions as a decentralized database. It is a distributed ledger system that records and validates transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions, and once added to the chain, the data cannot be altered or deleted.Originally, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin relied on mining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new coins. Mining consumes massive amounts of processing power and energy, even surpassing the power consumption of entire countries like Argentina. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work (mining) to proof-of-stake as its validation method, reducing costs and increasing the number of validators compared to other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.\nTo navigate the world of crypto trading, it’s crucial to familiarize yourself with essential terminology. Some key terms include:\nBy understanding these cryptocurrency fundamentals and blockchain technology, traders can make more informed decisions and navigate the exciting yet complex world of crypto trading.\nStarting your crypto trading journey is both thrilling and daunting, with over 20,000 crypto coins available. It’s vital to make a strategic choice. We’ll look at popular cryptocurrencies for beginners and key factors to consider.\nBeginners should focus on established cryptocurrencies with solid track records and significant market capitalization. Top options for new traders include:\nOther notable coins include XRP, Stellar (XLM), Solana (SOL), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These have shown strong performance and market presence. When evaluating crypto investments, consider market capitalization, historical performance, and real-world utility.\nHigh returns can be enticing, but thorough research is crucial before investing. Key factors to consider include:\nRemember, crypto market analysis is an ongoing process. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory changes, and emerging technologies to make informed investment decisions.\nBefore entering the realm of cryptocurrency trading, establishing a secure trading account on a reputable exchange is crucial. With over 500 platforms vying for users, selecting the best crypto trading platform is paramount. Binance, Bybit, and Kraken stand out for beginners, offering user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive educational resources.Ensure account security by employing strong, unique passwords and activating two-factor authentication (2FA). This additional safeguard guarantees account access remains exclusive to you, even if your password is compromised. Most exchanges also store the majority of users’ funds in cold storage, typically exceeding 90%, to protect against hacks or theft.\nTo identify the ideal crypto trading platform, several factors must be considered:\nTo adhere to regulations and thwart fraudulent activities, most exchanges necessitate a crypto exchange verification process, also known as Know Your Customer (KYC). This involves submitting proof of identity, such as a government-issued ID or passport, and proof of address, like a utility bill or bank statement. Though the verification process may be time-consuming, it’s indispensable for ensuring the security and legitimacy of your account.By meticulously choosing a reputable exchange, establishing a secure account, and fulfilling the required verification steps, you’ll be poised to embark on your crypto trading journey with confidence.\nCreating a well-defined trading strategy is crucial for success in the ever-changing crypto trading landscape. Whether you’re new to trading or have extensive experience, a clear plan is vital. It helps you navigate market volatility and make informed decisions. Consider your goals, risk tolerance, and available trading time when crafting your strategy.\nChoosing between day trading and long-term holding is a fundamental decision. Day trading involves buying and selling tokens within a day, aiming to profit from daily price movements. It focuses on liquid coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum, relying heavily on technical analysis to identify entry and exit points. On the other hand, long-term holding emphasizes investing in tokens with strong growth potential, holding them for extended periods despite short-term market fluctuations. This strategy has been successful for early Bitcoin investors who have held their positions for over a decade.\nTechnical analysis is vital for day traders. It involves studying historical price data and identifying patterns to make informed trading decisions.

These can significantly impact your success. The array of options includes trading platforms, apps, news sources, and educational materials. Each is designed to aid in navigating the complex world of cryptocurrencies.\nChoosing the best crypto trading apps is vital for efficient and secure trading. Exchanges like Binance stand out for their liquidity and global appeal. Bybit excels in derivatives trading, offering a user-friendly platform with advanced features. For those seeking regulatory compliance, Kraken is a reliable option.When selecting an exchange, consider liquidity, fees, geographical availability, and the variety of coins and trading pairs. These factors are crucial for making an informed decision.\nStaying informed about crypto developments is essential for making informed trading decisions. Sources like CoinDesk and CryptoSlate offer timely updates on market trends, project updates, and regulatory changes. Engaging with crypto communities on social media, forums, and Discord channels can provide valuable insights from experienced traders and enthusiasts.\nInvesting in crypto trading education is wise for both beginners and experienced traders.

This anticipated peak coincides with the inauguration of Donald Trump. K33’s analysis is based on historical patterns, suggesting that the final peak of this crypto cycle may occur on Jan. 17.\nWhat Happened: In a recent report, K33 has identified the incoming administration’s favorable stance on cryptocurrency as a key factor driving Bitcoin’s recent surge past the six-digit mark. Promises of a more supportive regulatory environment in Washington have contributed to this rally. However, K33’s head of research, Vetle Lunde, warned that market expectations might be overly optimistic regarding the pace of policy changes.\nK33 advised that the mid-January peak could be an ideal time for investors to reduce risk and secure profits in the short term. The firm used two methods to project Bitcoin’s price, estimating it could reach $146,000 based on past cycle peaks or $212,500 considering market capitalization growth.\nSee Also: Quantum Computing Stock QUBT Has More Than Doubled While Bitcoin Has Dropped Since Google’s ‘Willow’ Reveal: What Does This Mean?\nMeanwhile, Adrian Zduńczyk, a market technician, cautioned about potential corrections between late January and February, with declines ranging from 15% to 30%. Separate research by CCData also indicated a peak next year, albeit on a different timeline, following Bitcoin’s last halving event in April.\nWhy It Matters: The prediction of Bitcoin’s peak comes amid a backdrop of fluctuating market conditions. Recently, Bitcoin experienced a dip below $93,000 as the “Santa Claus Rally” lost momentum, but it quickly rebounded to $93,600 as traders seized the opportunity to buy the dip. This volatility highlights the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.\nAdditionally, prominent figures like Bill Gates have expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin, questioning its productivity as an asset class.

This is both a negative and a positive. A negative in that those higher prices might not come in the here and now (is this really a negative?), and a positive in that price is still technically stable with eventual higher prices at a later date, compared to if the spike had come sooner.\nWith the number getting high fast, this served to over-excite the market. There is an element of ‘money illusion’ at work in this in my opinion. Keep in mind also that price can always turn on a dime to the upside despite the sober technicals.”\nDave the Wave uses his version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs), which aim to forecast Bitcoin’s market cycle highs and lows while filtering out short-term volatility.\nLooking at the trader’s chart, he suggests that LGC’s support levels may be tested around the $70,000 range while the overall bullish trend remains intact.\nHe also says that Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase until it can break out of a key trendline.\n“BTC consolidation the order of the day until the downward diagonal can be broken. Technically, still very solid.”\nBitcoin is trading for $92,338 at time of writing, down 13.2% in the last two weeks.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nCategories\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nJOIN US ON X\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl","Sign in\nSign in\nCoinmonks is a non-profit Crypto Educational Publication.

Prices can surge or plummet dramatically within hours, leaving traders and investors scrambling to make informed decisions. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze and predict market movements, offering new levels of insight into the future of cryptocurrencies. This article explores how AI predicts the cryptocurrency market for 2025, delving into the methods, tools, challenges, and potential outcomes.\nAI has already made a significant impact on traditional financial markets, and its application in the cryptocurrency space is gaining momentum. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized, 24\/7 trading environment, generating vast amounts of data from exchanges, social media, news, and blockchain transactions. AI’s ability to process and analyze such large datasets quickly and accurately makes it indispensable for cryptocurrency predictions.\n1. Machine Learning (ML) AlgorithmsMachine learning, a branch of AI, allows systems to analyze data, adapt, and enhance their performance without the need for explicit programming. In cryptocurrency forecasting, ML models analyze historical price data, volume, and patterns to predict future trends. Popular ML models include:\nLinear Regression: For identifying relationships between variables like trading volume and price.Neural Networks: To detect complex patterns in time-series data.Reinforcement Learning: Where AI models improve their strategies based on simulated trading outcomes.\n2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)NLP enables AI to process and analyze textual data from news articles, social media, and online forums. By gauging market sentiment, AI can predict how public opinion might influence cryptocurrency prices. For example:\nPositive Sentiment: May indicate bullish trends.Negative Sentiment: Could signal potential sell-offs.\n3. Sentiment AnalysisAI systems use sentiment analysis tools to evaluate the tone of discussions around specific cryptocurrencies. Tracking trends on platforms like Twitter or Reddit allows AI to identify investor emotions and predict short-term market movements.\n4. Predictive AnalyticsAI leverages predictive analytics to anticipate future price movements by analyzing current and historical data. These analytics consider various factors, such as:\n5. Technical Analysis AutomationAI streamlines technical analysis by analyzing chart patterns, identifying support and resistance levels, and assessing various market indicators. This reduces the time and effort required for manual analysis while increasing accuracy.\nFor accurate predictions, AI requires access to diverse data sources, including:\nMarket Data: Historical and real-time price data from exchanges.Blockchain Data: On-chain metrics such as transaction volume, wallet activity, and mining stats.News Feeds: Financial news platforms and announcements.Social Media: Sentiment from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram.Macroeconomic Indicators: Trends like inflation or geopolitical events that might affect cryptocurrency adoption.\n1. Bitcoin’s Market InfluenceBitcoin (BTC) is often seen as a bellwether for the cryptocurrency market. AI models analyze Bitcoin’s price trends and network activity to predict its future performance. Factors include:\nMining difficulty and hash rate.Institutional investment trends.Global regulatory developments.\n2. Altcoin PredictionsAI evaluates altcoins individually, considering factors like:\nUnique use cases.Developer activity.Community support.Historical correlations with Bitcoin.\n3. Adoption MetricsAI tracks adoption indicators such as wallet growth, transaction volume, and the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance systems. These metrics are used to predict market expansion.\n4. Regulatory LandscapeAI incorporates legal and regulatory developments into its predictions. For example, changes in taxation policies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), or crypto bans can have significant impacts.\n5. Market Sentiment for Emerging TrendsAI identifies emerging trends, such as:\nDeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects.NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).Metaverse integration with cryptocurrencies.By understanding these trends, AI can forecast which sectors are likely to grow or decline by 2025.\nMarket VolatilityThe unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies poses a challenge for AI models, as sudden events can disrupt predictions.\nData Quality and VolumeAI requires accurate, high-quality data. Noise in data from unverified sources can lead to inaccurate predictions.\nRegulatory UncertaintyChanges in regulations can have unpredictable impacts, making it challenging for AI to anticipate such shifts.\nBlack Swan EventsUnforeseen events, such as hacks or macroeconomic crises, are difficult for AI to predict accurately.\nHuman Bias in AI ModelsAI models trained on biased datasets may inherit those biases, leading to skewed predictions.\n1. Enhanced AccuracyAs AI technology advances, its ability to analyze complex datasets and provide precise predictions will improve.
