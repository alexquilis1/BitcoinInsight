Conversely, the Ethereum spot ETFs were recently launched, and little data is available to evaluate their acceptance. In a recent study, I examine the potential implications of Ethereum spot ETFs for retail investors.\nWhile Ethereum futures-based ETFs have been trading since October 2023, spot ETFs provide investors with direct exposure to Ethereum (Del Castillo, 2024). These two types of ETFs differ significantly in their structure and regulatory implications. A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset, allowing investors to benefit from the asset’s current market price. In contrast, a futures-based ETF offers indirect exposure by holding various futures contracts, which can deviate from the spot price due to market conditions such as contango (where the futures price is higher than the spot price) and backwardation (where the current price is higher than prices trading in the futures market). While spot ETFs offer straightforward investment opportunities by closely tracking the asset’s market price, futures-based ETFs involve complexities and additional costs related to the rollover of futures contracts. These structural differences have important regulatory and investment implications that investors must carefully consider.[2]\nEthereum spot ETFs can streamline the investment process for retail investors, offering a more familiar and accessible avenue compared with direct cryptocurrency purchases. By enabling investors to buy and sell shares through existing brokerage accounts, these ETFs eliminate the need for navigating complex crypto exchanges or managing private keys associated with crypto wallets.\nFurthermore, spot ETFs usually have lower minimum investment requirements, typically a few hundred dollars, enabling participation in the market for those with limited capital. This accessibility extends to traditional investment platforms, such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, where the introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs offers retail investors an opportunity to diversify their portfolios with cryptocurrency exposure.\nThe potential benefits of Ethereum spot ETFs for retail investors include increased accessibility, convenience, and diversification opportunities. However, it also underscores the substantial risks, including high volatility and the inability to participate in staking.[3] As the cryptocurrency market evolves, regulatory clarity and investor education will be critical in balancing these benefits and risks.\nWhile Bitcoin spot ETFs present compelling long-term investment opportunities, Ethereum spot ETFs offer distinct advantages for retail investors, primarily due to the technological versatility and its broad application spectrum (Johnson, 2024). Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, Ethereum’s blockchain supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), enabling a variety of innovative use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This functional diversity provides Ethereum with a significant edge in promoting innovation and market disruption (Pineda, Jabba, and Nieto-Bernal, 2024).\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum show impressive historical returns of 25.19 percent and 25.94 percent annually from January 2018 through June 2024, but with high volatility – Bitcoin’s standard deviation is 68.41 percent, and Ethereum’s is 87.54 percent.[4] This volatility can lead to significant gains or losses, posing challenges for retail investors. In contrast, traditional investments like the Vanguard Bond Index and the S&P 500 Stock Index offer lower risk profiles and better risk-adjusted performance. It is necessary for retail investors to view cryptocurrency investments as long-term strategies due to their volatility, with an emphasis on patience and strategic commitment over short-term speculation.\nTable 1.\nHistorical Performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and S&P 500\nJanuary 2018 – June 2024\nTable 2 shows that over the study period both Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited relatively low correlations with the Vanguard Bond Fund and the S&P 500 Fund, as evidenced by correlation coefficients of 0.22 and 0.38 for Bitcoin and 0.24 and 0.42 for Ethereum.[5] This implies that the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum are fairly independent of the broader bond and stock markets. Because they have demonstrated both high returns and low correlations, integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into a portfolio could potentially improve both total returns and risk-adjusted returns by offering diversification benefits and reducing overall portfolio risk.\nTable 2.\nCorrelation of Returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bonds, and S&P 500\nJanuary 2018 – June 2024\nInvesting directly in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum presents significant challenges, particularly for retail investors who often lack the necessary knowledge to navigate this complex and rapidly evolving market.[6] Unlike traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, which requires a deeper understanding of technical concepts like smart contracts, decentralized finance, and tokenomics. Many retail investors enter the market without sufficient knowledge, driven by the fear of missing out. This lack of understanding can lead to common misconceptions, such as the belief that cryptocurrencies are guaranteed to yield high returns or that they are immune to market volatility. These gaps in knowledge can result in poor investment decisions and significant financial losses.\nThe impact of hype further complicates the landscape for retail investors. Media coverage and social media play substantial roles in shaping investor sentiment, often creating a buzz around cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This hype can lead to irrational exuberance, where investors make decisions based on the fear of missing out rather than sound financial principles. Influencers and viral posts can inflate expectations and drive speculative buying, pushing prices to unsustainable levels. When the hype subsides or when negative news arises, these inflated prices can collapse, leading to severe losses for those who bought in at the peak. This cycle of hype and crash underscores the importance of due diligence and a cautious approach when investing in cryptocurrencies.\nRetail investors keen on investing in Ethereum should strongly consider a spot ETF over holding the crypto outright. These ETFs provide a more accessible and familiar avenue for investors, facilitating purchase and sale through conventional brokerage accounts without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. With lower minimum investment requirements, Ethereum spot ETFs offer broader participation in the market, including through traditional investment platforms like IRAs and 401(k) plans. This accessibility not only enhances convenience but also promotes portfolio diversification with cryptocurrency exposure. While direct crypto investments entail high volatility and the inability to stake, Ethereum spot ETFs mitigate these risks while still tapping into the potential long-term benefits of cryptocurrency.\nENDNOTES\n[1] ETFs offer retail investors diversified exposure to various asset classes with liquidity, allowing for cost-effective trading throughout the day on regulated securities exchanges.\n[2] Cryptocurrency futures-based ETFs typically have expense ratios around 0.85 percent to 0.95 percent, while spot ETFs have significantly lower fees ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.30 percent.\n[3] Staking allows Ethereum token holders to earn income passively by validating transactions. However, investors in Ethereum ETFs cannot participate in staking activities because the SEC considers staked crypto to be an investment contract.\n[4] It almost goes with saying that past performance is no guarantee of future investment results.\n[5] Historical correlations in this range indicate a weak positive relationship and suggest there could be other factors influencing these assets’ price more significantly.\n[6] Investors who used the crypto exchange FTX faced substantial risks and incurred significant losses following its collapse in 2022.\nREFERENCES\nDel Castillo, M.

At the Bitcoin Prague event in June, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin could eventually hit a value of $8 million per coin.\nGiven Bitcoin's current price of roughly $60,000, that would imply a more than 13,000% return on investment. That's equivalent to Bitcoin skyrocketing in price from $450 to $60,000 -- a process that took nearly a decade. As a result, it might be tempting to dismiss this bold $8 million prediction. But there are two very good reasons why Saylor might just be right.\nGiven that Bitcoin is a digital currency created by an algorithm, it has some very specific properties that distinguish it from traditional money. For one, it has a finite supply. You can't just print more Bitcoin, the way a cash-strapped government can print dollars. Only 21 million coins can ever exist, and the Bitcoin algorithm carefully controls the overall circulating supply. Moreover, Bitcoin is a completely decentralized currency, meaning that no sovereign power or government can control it.\nIt's these properties, says Saylor, that help to make Bitcoin \"perfect money.\" It is anti-inflationary, making it a potential hedge against inflation. It is a superior long-term store of value, making it an alternative to physical gold. And it is resistant to government seizure, making it a potential safe haven asset if you live in a country with an overreaching central authority.\nOver time, Saylor suggests that the differences between Bitcoin and traditional currencies will become even starker, and that will lead to capital flowing into assets denominated in Bitcoin rather than dollars. It might also lead to Bitcoin revolutionizing the global financial system, as the world moves to a new Bitcoin standard.\nAdmittedly, if you're new to Bitcoin, all of this might sound incredibly optimistic. Indeed, Saylor -- who is arguably the highest-profile Bitcoin bull in the world right now -- is often so relentlessly bullish about the future of Bitcoin that some of his predictions ring hollow.\nYet, it's hard to deny that the U.S. government is running unsustainable deficits. By some estimates, the U.S. is adding $1 trillion in new debt every 100 days. At some point, people are going to stop buying U.S. government debt, and that's when the \"Bitcoin is perfect money\" scenario might start to play out.\nSaylor is also at the forefront of suggesting that companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury asset. That's the approach pioneered by MicroStrategy, which started an aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy in 2020. Since that time, MicroStrategy has bought so much Bitcoin that it is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world -- and it's not a close race. MicroStrategy now holds over 1% of all Bitcoin, worth approximately $15 billion.\nAccording to Saylor, holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet creates the potential for \"corporate immortality.\" Since the value of Bitcoin will increase in perpetuity, so will the value of a company.\nTo illustrate this point, Saylor points to the last 100 years of U.S. economic history. How many companies still exist from 100 years ago? A handful at best. In contrast, the final sliver of the last Bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140, so companies that hold significant amounts of Bitcoin today theoretically have the potential to live for at least 100 years.\nOver time, as more companies buy Bitcoin, the higher its price will go, as a result of this new buying pressure. Just keep in mind that, at a certain point, you may have to suspend belief for this scenario to play out. During the last Bitcoin bull market rally, for example, companies like Tesla were lining up to buy Bitcoin. However, that strategy hasn't exactly worked out the way they thought it would, due to Bitcoin's enormous volatility.\nObviously, at this point, you've probably realized that Saylor's $8 million price prediction is based more on a macro narrative about where the world is headed, rather than a numbers-driven, analytical model. So it's perfectly plausible that you might decide to pass on Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. Fair enough.\nBut, as Saylor warns, \"Everybody gets Bitcoin at the price they deserve.\" Saylor says he first thought about buying Bitcoin in December 2013, when it was trading at $892. But the Bitcoin story just seemed too good to be true. So he waited and waited, and finally bought Bitcoin when it was trading at $9,500. That was the price he deserved.\nWhile I remain unconvinced that Bitcoin is about to hit a price of $8 million anytime soon, I am convinced that there appears to be a paradigm shift taking place in the global economic order. For that reason, I'm growing increasingly bullish on Bitcoin's ability to rise in value over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Recently, influential crypto VC Andrew Kang warned of a potential retest of the $40,000 support level, which could lead to a significant price correction for Bitcoin.\nHowever, the decoupling of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETH\/USD from tech stocks, as discussed by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and macro trader Alex Krüger, could be a positive sign for the market, indicating a potential maturation and offering diversification benefits.\nMeanwhile, a report by 10x Research suggested that Bitcoin could plummet to $50,000 if it fails to maintain support above the crucial $60,000 level.\nDespite the market uncertainty, Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, offered an optimistic outlook for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, stating that positive legislation is likely regardless of the outcome of the next election.\nPrice Action: Bitcoin’s price is trading at $59,061 in last 24 hours, marking a decrease of 1.80%. Over the past month, the King Crypto has seen a significant decline of 16.27%. However, year-to-date, Bitcoin has shown strong performance with an increase of $14,889.10, representing a rise of 33.71%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\nWhy Is Bitcoin Down To $60K Today?\nImage Via Shutterstock\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Gox repayments and possible miner sales led to bitcoin dropping below $59,000, with major tokens like ether and Solana's SOL also declining.\nTrading firm QCP Capital anticipates a subdued market in the next quarter due to uncertainty around the Mt. Gox bitcoin supply release.\nFears of looming selling pressure on bitcoin {{BTC}} from defunct exchange Mt. Gox and possible miner sales pushed the largest cryptocurrency to under $59,000 on Thursday for the first time since late April.\nMt. Gox will start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack in July 2024, after years of postponed deadlines. The repayments will be made in bitcoin and bitcoin cash (BCH), and could add selling pressure to both markets, as previously reported.\nBTC lost 3.3% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with the sell-off beginning shortly after Tokyo equity markets opened for trading. Major tokens declined amid the BTC weakness: Ether {{ETH}} slumped 4%, while Solana’s SOL and dogecoin {{DOGE}} fell as much as 8%.\nThe broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, is down 4.8% in the past 24 hours.\nFutures trades betting on higher prices lost over $230 million in the past 24 hours, liquidations data tracked by CoinGlass shows. BTC and ETH-tracked futures saw over $60 million in long liquidations a piece, while products tracking DOGE, SOL, XRP, and pepe coin (PEPE) recorded at least $4 million in losses.\nFor long traders, these liquidations were the highest since late June. Crypto exchange Binance took over $110 million in liquidations, the most among counterparts.\nLiquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\nSuch data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.\nMeanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast on Telegram that they expect a dim market in the next few months.\n“We anticipate a subdued Q3 for BTC as the market remains uncertain around the supply from the Mt. Gox release,” QCP said."]}

Previous cycles, look what happened. Average true range picks up, dies off, dies off, dies off, and then you start to get a higher low form and by that stage, you’re really a decent way from the stealth zone.”\nAccording to the analyst, Bitcoin has historically made “stealth moves” to the upside when the ATR indicator reaches a local low and price continues to consolidate or puts in higher lows.\nThe analyst’s key price targets to the upside include $63,300 on the daily chart, $65,200 on the weekly chart and $72,000 on the monthly chart.\nBitcoin is trading for $60,176 at time of writing, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.\nNext up, the analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) will move toward its current cycle top.\n“With the higher lows and now trying to push higher above the 50% at $137. Next target on the weekly chart is $165. And then we go towards $190, $210. So $190 is above these tops. Then $210 is the current top for Solana. So it’s on its way. It hasn’t got those longer-term time frames confirmed yet, and those longer terms are the weeklies.”\nSolana is trading for $141 at time of writing, down more than 8% in the last 24 hours.\nLastly, the analyst predicts that Render (RNDR), the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering blockchain, will reclaim a double-digit value.\n“Now, what do we need to see until it gets there? Obviously higher lows, and that would happen throughout this next couple of months, maybe even up to four months as we get to that [US presidential] election… If I keep seeing higher lows, it’s not going to stop me from getting into the market if it breaks out through that period.”\nRender is trading for $7.04 at time of writing, down 7.7% in the last 24 hours.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nCategories\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nJOIN US ON X\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl","Bitcoin, the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency and the largest digital asset by market value, has crashed below $55,000, and experts in the crypto community have had a mix of wild, negative, hopeful, and defensive reactions to the coin's volatility play – some suggested something \"artificial\" is going on behind the scenes.\nBitcoin sheds $4,000 overnight\nThe leading digital currency went from $58,000 Thursday night to starting Friday at around $54,400, triggering a wave of liquidations among holders of $BTC and a host of other cryptocurrencies.\nData from CoinGecko shows that Bitcoin plummeted by over 7% in the last 24 hours and has been down by nearly 12% in the past week.\nHolders liquidate nearly $230 million\nCoinGlass data further showed that a total of $681.69 million has been cashed out by digital asset holders in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin holders led the pack, liquidating a whopping $229.47 million, followed by Ether ($ETH) holders, who cashed out $166.99 million. In the last four hours alone, over $150 worth of $BTC has been liquidated.\nMany crypto users have reacted negatively to the digital coin's plunge, and while many others agreed that the price correction during this cycle is \"historically very small,\" a sticking point in the crypto space overnight was the German government's continuous dumping of its seized Bitcoin stash.\nUPDATE: German Government selling up to $175M BTCIn the past 2 hours the German Government has moved 1300 BTC ($76M) to exchange deposits at Kraken, Bitstamp and Coinbase.They have also moved 1700 BTC ($99M) to address 139Po.

He noted that \"if Germany and the U.S. want to crash Bitcoin to zero,\" they should at least move faster before American markets open.\nI’m going to go to sleep soon but I set an alert if\/when we hit zero so I can pick up some free sats. Not guaranteed but if Germany and the US want to crash Bitcoin to zero they need to do it fast before US markets open and professional market makers are back at their desks.\nFormer Blockstream executive Samson Mow argued that the current price slump is a \"scam dip,\" and is an \"artificial price suppression,\" considering how the coincidences of the German government's dump, the holiday liquidity, and the repayments of collapsed crypto giant MtGox are \"too perfect.\"\nI stand by what I said on @PunterJeff and @ryQuant’s pod that this is artificial price suppression. The timing of it all to coincide with wallet movements from Germany and Gox, at a low liquidity holiday period is too perfect.\nIs the German government's dump to blame?\nFor pseudonymous investor Whale Panda, it is \"completely inaccurate\" to promote a narrative that $BTC crashed because of the German government's massive dump. He argued that a significant amount of cryptocurrencies that were \"sent out yesterday to exchanges came back from exchanges.\" Whale Panda is a well-followed figure in the crypto community.\nThe narrative that the German government just dumped the coins on the market and caused this crash is completely inaccurate.In fact you see that a large amount of coins that were sent out yesterday to exchanges... came back from exchanges. pic.twitter.com\/y4J8cWfTIn\nWill Germany bite Tron founder's offer?\nIn a bid to \"minimize the impact\" of Germany's latest Bitcoin sell-off spree on the overall crypto market, Justin Sun, the founder of blockchain-based decentralized system Tron, offered to snap up the government's $BTC treasury off-market. It is unclear if the German government has started negotiating with the crypto magnate.\nI am willing to negotiate with the German government to purchase all BTC off-market in order to minimize the impact on the market.\nTo sell or to buy?\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin maximalists – sometimes described as \"extreme\" holders – are unfazed, believing that the coin's crash will only pave the way for a giant leap to the top.

All rights reserved.","Two wallets have deposited 9,500 BTC to Binance, indicating a possible liquidation of nearly $550 million in cryptocurrency.\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, these transfers could represent large holders, or “whales,” cashing in on their bitcoin holdings, currently valued at $537 million. Initially, these assets were worth around $575 million when the transfers began.\nLookonchain’s analysis shows a correlation between these transfers to addresses tagged as Binance deposit wallets by Arkham Intelligence and subsequent declines in Bitcoin’s price, likely triggered by large sales.\nOne of the wallets still holds over 4,300 BTC, valued at nearly $250 million at current prices, with its latest deposit to a Binance address occurring two days ago. The crypto market has been unsettled recently due to movements associated with the repayment of creditors by the hacked exchange Mt. Gox, which has led to massive liquidations. The timeline for these repayments varies, with some creditors waiting up to three months to receive their coins.\nAccording to 10x Research, Bitcoin is expected to fall below $57,000 from over $60,000 on July 4, with a potential drop to $50,000. Breaking the psychological $60,000 benchmark towards $50,000 represents a major shift in market sentiment. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, noted that this decline was foreseeable, citing data from early June that hinted at an overbought market ripe for correction.\nThe recent 5.44% drop in Bitcoin’s price has impacted investor sentiment and market liquidity, with a 57% increase in trading volume. The 10x Research report suggests that the price decline “could accelerate as support gets broken and sellers scramble to find liquidity.”\nThielen explained that most crypto traders tend to be long-biased, but prices often decline once the last buyer has bought, causing a narrative shift. “Following the failed breakout on June 8, some of our trading models turned bearish on June 12 based on pattern analysis,” he said. The report advises traders to prioritize risk management in anticipation of continued volatility.\nThe sell-off coincides with the anticipated Mt. Gox repayments of $8.5 billion worth of BTC, set to begin in July. According to the 10x Research report, with the $60,000 support broken, “only ill-informed traders are willing to buy here.”\nThe 10x Research report maintains a cautious outlook for Bitcoin, advising traders to prepare for continued volatility. Thielen noted that the BTC rally in late May and June was driven by expectations of SEC approval for the ETH ETF, but over-positioning led to the recent correction. He suggested that Bitcoin might drop back to $50,000, with a potential further decline to $45,000.\nUnit No: BA857 DMCC Business Centre Level No 1 Jewellery & Gemplex 3 Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nInternational House, 10 Admirals Way, London, England, E14 9XL."]}

According to the FBI's March report, in 2023, crypto fraudsters seized just under $4 billion.\nThe report\nalso highlights a notable change in hacker tactics, with a 35% increase in\naccess control exploits. They refer to security incidents where attackers gain\nunauthorized access to systems, wallets, or accounts by exploiting weaknesses\nin authentication and authorization mechanisms.\nThese\nbreaches accounted for $491,311,000 in losses across 26 incidents, representing\na substantial portion of the total $629,689,000 lost in Q2 2024.

On Wednesday, July 10, Bitcoin showed a gain of over two percent, taking its value to $59,304 (roughly Rs. 49.5 lakh) on international exchanges like CoinMarketCap. On Indian exchanges, meanwhile, BTC managed to reflect a similar gain percentage to trade between the range of $57,906 (roughly Rs. 48.3 lakh) and $63,577 (roughly Rs. 53 lakh).\n“The crypto market showed initial signs of recovery as market begins to digest the impact of German government large BTC release, adding to the selling pressure. Bitcoin rose by almost three percent in the last 24 hours. We can expect the markets to remain choppy in the coming weeks. If Bitcoin breaches the $60,000 mark and stays above it for at least two weeks, then we can expect the momentum to sustain,” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin told Gadgets360.\nEther showed slightly different trajectories on national and international exchanges on Wednesday. The asset, with a gain of 1.06 percent on international exchanges, is trading at $3,115 (roughly Rs. 2.6 lakh). In India, ETH's price is hovering over the mark of $3,313 (roughly Rs. 2.76 lakh) after seeing a small loss of 1.7 percent, as per Gadgets360's crypto price tracker.\n“Caution lingers as the market will absorb 75,000 to 118,000 BTC worth $4.3 billion (roughly Rs. 35,902 crore)-6.8 billion (roughly Rs. 56,776 crore) from Saxony and Mt. Gox customers. The Fed's inflation response with rate hikes is a cloud on the horizon, but controlled inflation could bring price increases,” commented Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder and CEO Pi42 on Wednesday's crypto market situation.\nTether, Binance Coin, Solana, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Litecoin, and Chainlink reflected losses on the crypto charts on Wednesday.\nHowever, a bunch of cryptocurrencies did manage to see small gains on Wednesday. These include Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, Near Protocol, Polygon, and Uniswap.\nThe overall crypto market cap rose by 2.73 percent in the last 24 hours. With this, the valuation of the sector is now at $2.17 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,81,18,089 crore), as per CoinMarketCap.\nMarket analysts, manwhile, are closely observing the market movement of Toncoin – which is the native token of the Telegram-linked TON blockchain.\n“After reaching a low of $7.09 (roughly Rs. 0.085), TON is now trading at $7.28 (roughly Rs. 0.087). Increased whale activity is evident, with nine major transactions totalling 359,000 TON in the past 24 hours, indicating investor optimism,” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets360. “TON's price resilience and strategic buying during dips are shown by its ability to maintain above key support levels, with the 50 EMA and 100 EMA serving as crucial indicators.”\nCryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.

Bitcoin has almost 54% share of the crypto market with a market capitalization of $1.33 trillion, as of July 20. The market move depends on the overall movement of Bitcoin. Whereas, cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) are considered alternatives to Bitcoin and they sometimes tend to move opposite to Bitcoin. In addition, cryptos such as Ethereum and XRP have unique features and use cases. For instance, XRP’s money transfer network, Ripple, serves the financial services industry’s needs. XRP’s Ripple has collaborations with Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE:CM), and Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (NSE:KOTAKBANK), among others. These are some of the leading banks that use XRP’s RippleNet for swift, low transaction cost, and versatile exchange network transfer technology.\nAround 13.7% of the population in the US owned cryptocurrencies in 2022, according to the US International Trade Commission. The US is one of the leading countries with the highest cryptocurrency adoption. In April 2023, there were almost 420 million global cryptocurrency users.\nThe cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $2.40 trillion, as of July 20, 2024. The crypto market capitalization was less than half a year ago, around $1.20 trillion, as of July 20, 2023. On January 1, 2024, the market cap had surged to $1.66 trillion. The surge in the crypto market was because of the rise of Bitcoin, mainly driven by the approval of Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the US SEC and the Bitcoin halving event. These major developments have injected a new bullish sentiment among investors. The difference can be seen with the increase in the trading volume of cryptocurrencies. As per Coinmarketcap, the trading volume of cryptocurrencies was around $84 billion on July 20, 2024, compared to $36 billion a year ago.\nBitcoin halving is an important event that reduces the rate of issuance of new BTC and the rewards for successful bitcoin miners are cut in half. Almost 21 million Bitcoins will ever be produced and halving reduces amount of new supply of BTC which impacts the rate of new BTC coins. On April 20, the fourth Bitcoin halving took place. The immediate impact of the halving is felt by miners, who experience the block rewards cut in half. According to an analyst, Megan Stals, “Bitcoin trading volume generally sees the most significant increase in the 60 days prior to halvings, as interest builds and prices gain momentum.”\nBitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a slight improvement in their market dominance. On January 1, 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum had a dominance of 52.08% and 16.50%, respectively. On July 20, 2024, Bitcoin dominated with almost 54% and Ethereum dominated with a 17% share. The Coinmarketcap Crypto Fear and Greed index shows a score of 60.06 compared to 67.58 on January 1, 2024. The CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index by Coinmarketcap indicates the market buying and selling sentiment. A score closer to 0 means an extreme market fear and shows investors have oversold irrationally, while a score closer to 100 means an extremely greedy market and indicates a potential market correction. The score of 60.06 signals a slightly greedy market, however, it is to be noted that it is below the score of 67.58, at the beginning of the year when the market started a bull run.\nMark Cuban recently pointed out that if the US dollar declines as the global reserve currency, Bitcoin could become a ‘safe-haven’ globally. Countries suffering from hyperinflation are already investing in Bitcoin. Ukraine and Vietnam are two of the leading countries that use crypto and bitcoin the most.\nOver $3 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been removed from centralized crypto exchanges since the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US on May 23. The Glassnode data shows that the supply of Ethereum held on exchanges is at its lowest level in years at around 10.6%. As per the CryptoQuant data, the total Ethereum on exchanges has plunged by almost 797,000 between May 23 and June 2, worth approximately $3.02 billion. The low supply of Ethereum on exchanges means that fewer ETH coins are available for sale. On May 28, The DeFi report crypto analyst Michael Nadeau said that Ethereum could take advantage of demand pressures compared to Bitcoin, as it does not have the same level of ‘structural sell pressure’ as BTC. Nadeau further added:\n“ETH is a tech play on the growth of Web3. A ‘call option’ or ‘high-growth index for Web3 adoption.’ Whereas Bitcoin is ‘digital gold.’”\nWeb3 is a rising industry and is expected to bring in an annual revenue of $33.5 billion by 2030, as per the data by Grand View Research. In addition, Ethereum’s ETF has been approved by the SEC following the regulators’ approval of Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. The chief investment office at Bitwise, Matt Hougan, on the Ethereum ETF approval said:\n“We’ve now fully entered the ETF era of crypto. Investors can now access more than 70% of the liquid crypto asset market through low-cost ETPs.”\nOn June 3, CoinShares released its ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows’ weekly report which showed that the digital asset funds experienced a fourth consecutive week of inflows. The digital asset funds recorded $185 million in weekly inflows for the last week of May 2024, with total monthly inflows of around $2 billion. As of May 2024, the year-to-date inflow of capital in the crypto market has crossed $15 billion.\nBitcoin was the leading cryptocurrency with $148 million in investment flows for the last week of May 2024, while short Bitcoin funds experienced $3.5 million in weekly outflows. This reflects the bullish sentiment among BTC investors. In addition, Bitcoin’s total inflows for May 2024 accounted for $1.95 billion, taking the year-to-date tally to $17.74 billion. Ethereum experienced the second-highest inflows of $33.5 million in the last week of May 2024. Solana also saw a notable increase in weekly inflows, reported at around $5.8 million, taking the full month inflows to $24.8 million and year-to-date inflows to $35 million.\nThe most weekly inflows came from the US worth $130 million, despite Grayscale Investments outflows increasing to $260 million. Switzerland experienced the second-largest week of inflows at $36 million, while Canada had the third-highest inflows at $25 million in the last week of May 2024.\nCME Group Inc.

The cryptocurrency\n world is no different, with the dominant Bitcoin battling runner-up \nEthereum for market share.\nRegardless of whose corner you stand \nin, cryptocurrencies are here, tradeable and making the news. If you \nbought Bitcoin at a low, through genuine luck or pure brilliance, you \nmight be looking to 'cash out' now. Finding out what your holdings are \ncurrently worth, can be done by simply clicking BTC to CAD or typing BTC to USD, or a currency of your choice, into a search engine.\nOnce\n on the site, you will have to access to up-to-date cryptocurrency \nconversion rates, conversion tables, historical price data, Bitcoin news\n and a FAQ's section. These sites are a fantastic way to run conversion \nchecks, which help you calculate what your Bitcoins are worth in your \nlocal currency. Done regularly and keeping track of findings, allows you\n to see market trends and decide on the right time to sell.\nRead on to find out how to convert your Bitcoin easily and safely.\nBitcoin\n was not the first cryptocurrency invented, but it has certainly become \nthe most popular. It is one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, with the \nmost trade volume by a huge margin. The immense size of its trade \nvolume, has gotten banks, private equity funds and even governments and world leaders into the crypto debate.\nBitcoin\n was registered online in August of 2008 as bitcoin.org. With the first \ntransaction of 10 Bitcoins occurring a few months later, in January of \n2009.\nThe first notable exchange of Bitcoin for physical goods \nwas done on the 22nd of May 2010. 10 000 Bitcoins were traded for two \npizzas from American pizza franchise Papa John's located in \nJacksonville, Florida. The Jacksonville local, Laszlo Hanyecz, posted in\n a Bitcoin forum asking if anyone could order him two pizzas. A forum \nuser, Jeremy Sturdivantuser, from England accepted and ordered the \npizzas to be delivered to Hanyecz. The event would become infamous \namongst crypto currency fans, as 'Bitcoin Pizza Day'. The 10 000 \nBitcoins were worth around 40 USD at the time of the trade, as of July \n2024, 10 000 Bitcoins would be worth a little over 580 million USD.\nBitcoin\n prices, valuations, transactions and news were typically negotiated and\n shared on the Bitcoin forum. With cryptocurrencies placed on the open \nmarket, they have become susceptible to more competition\n as well as market fluctuation. Users have moved from trading via forums\n to placing their Bitcoins into personal cryptocurrency wallets and \ntransacting through online exchanges.\nBitcoin\n is classed as a digital asset. Meaning it must be exchanged for fiat \ncurrency before it can be withdrawn as actual cash. A fiat currency is a\n national currency, such as the pound, euro or dollar. These currencies \nare not typically tied or pegged to an underlying commodity such as gold\n or silver, but rather maintain their value through a shared 'belief' of\n value by the country's citizens. The country's government or central \nbank would most commonly be the issuer of fiat currency.\nJust like with fiat currency, the value you receive when selling or trading your Bitcoin depends on the cryptocurrency market\n and the levels of supply and demand. Users need to be aware that \nexchange fees can be added to both the buying and selling of Bitcoin, as\n trades occur over online cryptocurrency exchanges which take a cut of \neach transaction. Competition amongst exchanges over the years has seen \nfees drop from low single figure percentages all the way down to tenths \nor even hundredths of a percent. Online searches will help you find an \nexchange best suited to your needs.\nStablecoins are an option for \nthose interested in the cryptocurrency sphere, but wanting less possible\n volatility. Stablecoins peg themselves on a fiat currency or a \ncommodity such as gold. The introduction of Stablecoin has opened the \nmarket to a new wave of interested investors.\nNow that you have \ndecided on a suitable exchange, understood their fees and chosen your \ntiming wisely, the process of selling your Bitcoin can begin. The \nBitcoin is converted to fiat cash, which is stored in your exchange \naccount. Meaning that you will have created a fiat wallet as well as a \ncrypto wallet, which may contain any Bitcoin yet to be converted.\nAfter\n your Bitcoins have been converted to fiat currency, you can link your \nbank account to the wallet and transfer the funds over to a regular \naccount.\nAn alternative is to buy products directly using your \nBitcoin, such as clothing items, gift cards, hotel stays and airline \ntickets. Your Bitcoin can be linked to your fiat card, meaning you are \nessentially cashing out by making purchases of regular products. A final\n option is using a Bitcoin ATM, just bear processing times, admin fees \nand the availability of such ATM's in your area in mind.\nCryptocurrency\n decisions, as with most money decisions, need to be done carefully and \nthoughtfully. Be sure to do your homework, understand the fine print and\n fee structures, compare products, keep an eye on the market and know \nhow much actual currency your Bitcoins will be worth once sold.\nTags\nTop Brokers\nSponsored\nMost Popular\nStock Daily Updates\nMust Read",null]}
