And the daily is also excellent. We are at resistance, and that’s kind of what we’re battling with but it’s been a resistance that’s been tested a bunch of times — this is the sixth time. That’s a lot. That’s not something I would necessarily want to fade….\nI’m going to assume it’s a real all-time high breakout that is coming. Right now I’m team breakout.”\nHowever, the analyst warns that next week’s US presidential election could create market volatility in the short-term.\nHe says some investors are front-running Bitcoin on the belief that Republican Donald Trump will win. Trump is seen as more pro-crypto than his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris.\n“The only problem that we have that makes this a little bit of a risky trade, in my opinion, is that the US elections are coming. And the bet on Bitcoin has kind of been a bet on Trump before the elections.\nRight now, Bitcoin is pricing in a Trump win. That’s kind of what this recent price action has been, and what we’re going to get going into the election. People are thinking Trump is going to win, especially crypto people… If Trump loses, I think there’s a good chance that it goes short-term lower.”\nThe analyst believes that in the long-term whoever is elected will not play a significant factor in Bitcoin’s price.\n“Generally speaking, whether Harris or Trump wins, I don’t think has much of an impact on where this is going to go… like the price whether Trump or Harris wins in a year would be roughly the same.”\nBitcoin is trading for $69,941 at time of writing, down 3.3% in the last 24 hours.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nCategories\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nJOIN US ON X\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl","Bitcoin remains just shy of its all-time high, potentially biding its time for the election results. Speculation about who will become the 47th president of the United States—Donald Trump or Kamala Harris—has created an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and doubt within the crypto community. A lot of polls indicate a close race between the two candidates.\nEarlier this week, the leading cryptocurrency peaked at $73,562, just below 1% of its record high of $73,737, which it reached in March. However, since then, Bitcoin has slipped, falling to the $70,000 mark. Currently, Bitcoin’s price appears largely stagnant, as it seems to await the election results with bated breath.\nMany are already speculating on how Bitcoin might respond to a potential victory by either Trump or Harris. Debates are emerging over which outcome would be more favorable for the cryptocurrency in the long run.\nThere’s little doubt that Bitcoin will soar if Trump wins. The former President positioned himself as a “crypto candidate,” actively embracing digital assets as part of his campaign. He even started accepting campaign donations in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana, among others.\nOf course, not all crypto enthusiasts are Trump supporters, but many welcome his recent pro-crypto stance. For instance, at a Bitcoin conference, Trump promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office — a move that resonates strongly with crypto advocates, as Gensler’s policies have often been unpopular in the cryptosphere. Trump further promised to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, an ambitious goal that has captivated many in the crypto community.\nOn the other hand, Vice President Harris, who had previously been cautious about discussing cryptocurrencies, recently began to address the topic more openly. She has called for stronger regulatory oversight of the crypto market, emphasizing the need for clear rules to ensure consumer protection and financial stability.\nGiven Kamala Harris’s late and lukewarm response to Bitcoin, many anticipate an immediate dip in leading cryptocurrency’s price if she wins, followed by a possible rebound later.\nBitcoin’s reluctance is affecting the entire crypto market, leaving major cryptocurrencies seeming hesitant to make significant moves in either direction. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $2,500, reflecting a slight dip of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Additionally, popular memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIBA), known for their volatility, remained stable on Friday, with minor declines of 0.7% and 1%, respectively.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.","Earned 236 BTC in October 2024 & Increased Bitcoin Treasury to 1,188 BTC\n- Earned 236 BTC in October 2024 & Increased Bitcoin Treasury to 1,188 BTC -\nThis news release constitutes a \"designated news release” for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated October 4, 2024, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated November 10, 2023.\nTORONTO, Nov. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd.

All financial references are in U.S. dollars.\nIn October, Bitfarms announced a second hosting agreement with Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (\"Stronghold”) that will deploy 10,000 miners, originally scheduled for Yguazu, Paraguay, to Stronghold's Scrubgrass site. This follows an initial hosting agreement for 10,000 miners signed in September for a total of 20,000 miners to be deployed at Stronghold's two sites in Pennsylvania. The two hosting agreements support approximately 4 EH\/s with energization expected in several tranches over the coming months.\nCEO Ben Gagnon stated, \"While we are pleased to have reached our year-end efficiency goal of 21 w\/TH three months ahead of schedule, we recognize that we are behind schedule on delivering our mid-year 12 EH\/s target. Despite improvements in recent miner shipments, continued miner warranty servicing has impeded the achievement of our hash rate target.

Many are labeling this sharp decline to the $68,000 level as the “biggest Bitcoin crash,” signaling that the most significant downturn in Bitcoin’s history has just started.\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment has noted the recent Bitcoin crash, highlighting the decreasing number of non-empty wallets by investors. According to the analytical platform, there have been 211,540 fewer addresses than three weeks ago. This massive reduction is seen as a sign of intense Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) typically associated with future bullish performance and a strained market.\nCurrently, the crypto market is in suspense mode as investors, both retail and institutional, await the results of the US Presidential elections. Even large-scale Bitcoin investors, often called ”Whales,” have been relatively mute, adopting a “Wait-And-See” attitude as they closely watch how the results of the US election impact the dynamics of the market.\nSantiment also notes that Bitcoin whales have been reducing their transaction activity, signaling a change in market sentiment. The market intelligence stated that “Bitcoin whales are patiently awaiting the US Presidential election results as their activity settles from last week’s spike near crypto’s top.\nThe outcome of the US elections are expected to start pouring in today, and many crypto traders and investors are already preparing for major market volatility and unpredictability. On X (formerly Twitter), there has also been a spike in mentions related to Presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has gained significant support from various crypto community members.\nMany crypto analysts hold varying opinions and predictions regarding the future of the crypto market after the US presidential elections. With major candidates, Kamala Harris or Trump vying for Presidency, investors and crypto experts are closely watching the market for changes.\nAccording to crypto analyst Crypto Rover, the last time former President Trump won the US election, Bitcoin pumped 2,714%. The analyst has suggested that if history repeats itself, that is, if Trump wins the current Presidential elections and Bitcoin price experiences a similar surge, then the pioneer cryptocurrency could be worth $2 million by 2025.\nMoreover, Santiment has revealed that in the previous election in November 2016, Bitcoin crashed by 5.5% after Trump was announced as President. In contrast, in November 2020, the Bitcoin price surged by 22.6% after Joe Biden was announced as President.\nBased on social sentiment on X, it appears many members of the crypto community are supporting Trump as the next US President. However, Adam Khoo, a crypto analyst, has noted that over 50 million US citizens have already voted in the US elections, with exit polls showing a significant landslide victory for Harris.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

With cryptocurrencies becoming an increasingly important part of global finance, understanding how a Trump victory could shape regulatory policies and affect market sentiment is crucial for investors, developers, and stakeholders within the crypto space.\nPolicy Shifts: Regulatory Uncertainty or Positive Momentum?\nOne of the most critical factors influencing the future of the cryptocurrency market under a Trump administration is the potential for regulatory change. Trump's prior term was characterized by a more laissez-faire approach to financial regulations, with a focus on deregulation. However, the current crypto market has evolved significantly since his first presidency, prompting a need for clear and effective policies to address issues such as market manipulation, taxation, and security.Trump's stance on blockchain technology and digital currencies has been somewhat unpredictable. During his first term, his administration largely took a hands-off approach to crypto regulation, allowing the market to grow without imposing stringent controls. This could signal a continuation of a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies, where innovation and market growth are prioritized over regulation.However, in a second term, there may be more pressure to formalize crypto regulations, especially concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing institutional interest in crypto assets could prompt more aggressive regulatory actions, particularly regarding the protection of retail investors and maintaining market integrity.Trump's administration may also prioritize the development of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), further driving the broader acceptance of blockchain technology in the financial sector. If executed correctly, a U.S. CBDC could enhance the role of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance, providing a clear pathway for institutional adoption.\nMarket Sentiment: Optimism vs. Caution\nIn terms of market sentiment, a Trump victory could introduce a blend of optimism and caution among investors. On one hand, many in the crypto community may welcome a continuation of Trump's pro-business policies, which could foster greater institutional adoption of digital assets. Trump's prior administration oversaw an expansion in the availability of Bitcoin futures, and his focus on economic growth could result in an environment where the value of digital currencies continues to rise.On the other hand, Trump's return to the White House could increase volatility in the crypto market, especially if his administration takes a more aggressive stance toward regulation. While his presidency may favor reduced taxes and lower corporate regulations, it could also lead to uncertainty regarding the future of decentralized technologies and crypto adoption. Additionally, investors could be concerned about the potential for geopolitical risks, especially in a divided political environment.Given the increasing influence of cryptocurrency in global markets, Trump's policies could influence how international investors view the U.S. as a destination for blockchain innovation. A stable regulatory environment and a clear stance on crypto assets could attract more global investment in the sector, whereas uncertainty or overly strict regulations could drive innovation overseas.\nConclusion: A Waiting Game for Crypto Investors\nAs the U.S. election approaches, the outcome will undoubtedly have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrencies. A Trump victory may offer a continuation of the pro-business, deregulatory approach that could benefit the crypto market by fostering innovation and allowing for more widespread adoption of digital assets. However, it also opens the door for increased regulatory scrutiny and potential market volatility.For crypto investors, the key will be closely monitoring any policy shifts or regulatory announcements that could directly impact their investments. As always, the cryptocurrency market's inherent volatility means that both risks and opportunities abound, and a Trump administration could potentially serve as a catalyst for both.\nAbout Toobit\nToobit is a leading cryptocurrency exchange offering a wide range of services to traders and investors globally.

Analysts say it's time to buy cryptos, but with caution."],"article_contents":["As interest in cryptocurrencies continues to surge, driven by each new price rally, crypto assets have solidified their position as one of the main asset classes in global markets. Unlike traditional assets, which primarily trade during standard working hours, cryptocurrencies trade 24\/7, presenting a unique landscape of liquidity and volatility. This continuous trading environment has prompted us to investigate how Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, behaves across intraday and overnight periods. With Bitcoin’s growing availability to both retail and institutional investors through ETFs and other investment vehicles, we hypothesized that trading activity in these distinct timeframes could reveal patterns similar to those seen in traditional markets, where returns are often impacted by liquidity shifts during off-peak hours.\nWe have been covering the concepts and topics relating to crypto extensively. For more similar articles, check our cryptocurrency trading research subpage or look for the articles with the “cryptocurrencies” tag on our blog. Alternatively, you can visit our extensive library of cryptocurrency trading strategies.\nThis study’s primary purpose is\nReferencing the graph from our prior research on the Lunch Effect in the S&P 500 and other major U.S. stock indices, we observed that most SPY and stock index performance accrues largely during the nightly sessions:\nAnd for putting things into perspective, here is a shorter sample from the research paper published in 2008 (as we can see, not a lot has changed over the last 16 years):\nOvernight Anomaly as presented by Cliff, Cooper, Gulen: Return Differences between Trading and Non-Trading Hours: Like Night and Day.\nOur objective and goal, therefore, is to understand the impact of daily and nightly sessions on Bitcoin performance, particularly in light of the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. This indicates there might be a shift from 24\/7 trading to a more structured trading environment akin to those on traditional exchanges (such as the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, ARCA, and so on).\nWe suspect that since inflows and outflows from ETFs trading on these TradFi domains are highly tied to exchanges’ open hours, it will become more prevalent that Bitcoin trading changes are more and more tied to those of traditional assets such as equities and bonds.\nInstitutional traders usually unload or initiate (take) positions primarily at the open(ing) and close of the main session, where they have enough liquidity to satisfy their orders (not accounting for block trades in dark pools or TWAP orders during the day); hence, the first and last trading moments in terms of time-span of minutes in daily trading sessions are erratic and volatile (which day-traders strive for; ordinary investors not much so). Add market makers’ interests in mind, which may be some over-standing inventory on their books they need to liquidate, as well as options dealers hedging their flows. You get the perfect time for conflicting interests that frequently support the price discovery and move the price toward the market’s consensus view, usually forming the trend in traded assets for the rest of the day.\nThese things were unknown primarily to Bitcoin, as it was traded in many decentralized venues (spot or futures), which allowed only instantaneous price arbitrage among them if liquidity constraints were in favorable conditions.\nBitcoin is traded nonstop and often can be the first, riskiest asset readily liquidated in anticipation of upcoming volatility, such as (geo)political tensions or other unspecified extreme and non-predictable events when traditional finance exchanges are closed. Now that Bitcoin has received Wall Street’s blessing and approval and is accepted as a legitimate asset class by ETFs, the SEC is also becoming a little bit less strict in regulation by taking small steps such as approving options trading on said ETFs, BeInCrypto informed in late October. So, have Bitcoin’s unique characteristics regarding sessions’ distribution of returns become distorted, shifted, reversed, and are now more resembling time-tested assets like ETFs and stocks?\nOur analysis is based on the hourly BTC data from the Gemini Data page in intervals ranging from 2015-10-08 to 2024-10-15. We define the daily session as performance between 10 am EST and 4 pm EST during trading days when the NYSE exchange is opened. All of the hours out of this interval are defined as overnight sessions. It’s the same data source we used in our previous article in which we revisited trend-following and mean-reversion strategies in Bitcoin.\nWe assume that the underlying futures of ETF BITO can accurately track and predict the influence of cryptocurrencies’ “institutionalization” exactly from its Inception Date on 2021-10-18. Therefore, for simplicity, we split our sample into an in-sample period (until October 2021, during which the simple ETF trading vehicle was not available for BTC trading) and an out-of-sample period (after October 2021).\nWe understand that our definition of in-sample and out-of-sample periods is very arbitrary. It’s not possible to define the exact time when Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) became a traditional asset and was no longer considered an exotic investment. The line between traditional assets and alternative assets is a blurry one. What we want to show is that there is\/was a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior in overnight and intraday sessions over time.\nAfter collecting all the needed data, we started processing it and developing our initial investigation.\nThe following graph analysis illustrates returns during daily vs. nightly trading sessions over time:\nWe highlighted milestones of our interest and marked the launch of the first BTC ETF (2021-10-18) within the graph with a thick grey line.\nAs an overview, we put two points of crucial observations:\nThe theory about the “Overnight Effect” posits that most performance in risky assets such as equities is realized during nightly (so from close to open; “nocturnal”) trading sessions as compensation for the associated risks. That is a time when you cannot usually trade a lot, so when you hold an asset overnight, you are compensated for its illiquidity (or lower liquidity) with higher performance. As Bitcoin increasingly integrates into traditional financial systems, this principle is also expected to apply to BTC.\nOur constructed close-to-open versus open-to-close performance graph above confirms the previously outlined theoretical assumptions. Initially (until around 2021), the performance of the BTC during daily sessions was significantly positive, and BTC holders could multiply their assets with a low risk (volatility and drawdowns). The nightly sessions offered higher performance but also higher risk (volatility and drawdowns). As Bitcoin gradually became an asset class similar to other main asset classes, returns over the daily sessions diminished, and most of the BTC returns since 2021 were realized during the nightly sessions. This is precisely the same pattern as in stocks or equity indexes!\nLet’s move on and decompose Bitcoin’s performance by individual trading days (Monday, Tuesday, etc.), analyzing close-to-open, open-to-close, and close-to-close sessions. According to our definition, Monday night’s performance includes the period from Friday close to Monday morning (the whole weekend with traditional finance, whether securities or forex, exchanges are closed). Tuesday night’s performance includes the period from Monday’s close (4 pm EST) until Tuesday’s open (10 am EST), etc.\nThe results are displayed in tabular and graphical formats, with a conclusion indicating that the primary (most contributing) performance occurs on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday close-to-close sessions. However, this performance is driven mainly by the nightly sessions. So Bitcoin moves to the positive territory mainly between Friday’s close and Monday’s open (so over the weekend), between Monday’s close and Tuesday’s open, and between Tuesday’s close and Wednesday’s open. As we move closer to Friday, Bitcoin’s performance diminishes (in intraday and overnight sessions, too). It seems that, ultimately, there really exists a “Weekend Effect” in Bitcoin returns—a significant impact of Saturdays and Sundays when traditional financial exchanges (like NYSE) are closed.\nOK, we know that BTC is sensitive to the overnight\/intraday split and it’s sensitive to the Weekend Effect. Now, the question is, what can we do about it? Our next sections aim to find a way to profit from this finding.\nFirstly, we took our older trend-following study and replicated the MAX strategy with 5-day, 10-day, and 50-day high parameters.\nOur trend-following and mean-reversion study was backtested on daily bars with 0.00 GMT time stamps and using a 24\/7 trading calendar (trades can be executed on Saturdays, Sundays, and also during public holidays). Therefore, our first step was to check how the trend-following strategy that buys new local highs (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50-days) performs if we limit our trading decisions and can trade only on the ETF market close at 4 pm on days when the NYSE is open. We used Gemini data and the NYSE calendar to create such data series and tested our MAX strategy on it. This simple strategy (buy a Bitcoin in the form of cryptocurrency, futures contract, CFD, or ETF at NYSE close, when Bitcoin is on the local X-day high, hold for one trading day) can be easily executed with ETFs from 2021 onwards. However, we are not using the actual ETF closing prices but Gemini BTC data. This allows us to study the strategy’s performance even before any Bitcoin ETFs were introduced.\nAnd here we have a comprehensive graph showcasing all versions in aggregate for the trading period from close-to-close, along with detailed tables:\nFor consistency with our prior publications, we ultimately moved forward and used a 10-day version despite it not being optimal with the highest returns. This version, for purposes of this research publication, requires the presentation of close-to-open and open-to-close performance graphs, tables, and an appropriate summary as previously described:\nAs we can see, Bitcoin MAX strategy performed better during the first sub-period before the first ETF introduction. In the out-of-sample period, the strategy still has over 35% performance with a minimal -12% maximal drawdown (and significantly outperforms the underlying Bitcoin market on a risk-adjusted basis), but as Bitcoin has become a generally accepted, mainstream asset class, the simple trend-following strategy that buys new local highs doesn’t offer the same juice as before. What can we do about it? Let’s focus our attention on the overnight anomaly and filter our trades a little. It’s the same trick we used when we were investigating the overnight reversal in the high-yield market.\nFirstly, we can try to investigate the 10-day MAX strategy in close-to-open and open-to-close sub-periods (just a short reminder that in-sample is until October 2021, and out-of-sample [OOS] is from October 2021 onwards):\nThis section demonstrates that most returns of the MAX(10) strategy throughout history, both in-sample and out-of-sample, are generated during the overnight trading session (from close to open).\nOK, we are near the end of our analysis. We learned that Bitcoin is sensitive to intraday vs. overnight split, to the day-of-the-week (or Weekend) effect, plus it trends a lot (once, when it’s on the local high, then it usually continues in positive trend and ultimately to the higher price). Therefore, we propose a consolidated MAX(10) strategy, which operates exclusively during night sessions spanning Friday to Monday night, Monday to Tuesday night, or Tuesday to Wednesday night. This final strategy is illustrated with a single equity curve, performance table, and an analysis of the strategy’s performance both in-sample (up to 2021) and out-of-sample:\nWe have an excellent example of the combination of weekend and overnight effects, as you can go long on Friday’s close if you are on a local 10-day MAX, hold the BTC until Monday morning (open), and go long again on Monday’s and\/or Tuesday’s close if the Bitcoin is still on the local 10-day MAX. The strategy offers an attractive Sharpe ratio and low risk and shows that Bitcoin is still a young asset, burdened by inefficiencies much more than traditional, mature general asset classes and their constituents.\nIn light of our analysis, the simple strategy focused on nightly trading sessions has yielded substantial insights into Bitcoin’s performance dynamics. The strategy, operating exclusively during night sessions from Friday to Monday, Monday to Tuesday, and Tuesday to Wednesday, has demonstrated that a significant portion of Bitcoin’s returns is realized overnight. This pattern is consistent with traditional asset classes, where the Overnight risk premium is recognized, suggesting that as Bitcoin integrates more into conventional financial markets, its return distribution mirrors that of established assets.\nThe findings from this strategy indicate that Bitcoin, despite its unique characteristics and the 24\/7 trading environment, behaves similarly to other financial instruments when subject to institutional trading patterns. This suggests a gradual alignment with traditional market behaviors, potentially driven by the increasing participation of institutional investors and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. These results highlight the importance of considering trading session dynamics when developing trading strategies and risk management frameworks for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn conclusion, our study reinforces that the overnight effect significantly drives Bitcoin’s performance. The strategy’s success underscores the value of focusing on specific trading sessions to optimize returns and manage risks effectively. As Bitcoin continues to gain legitimacy and integrate into traditional financial systems, ongoing research will be essential to adapt trading strategies and capitalize on emerging trends, ensuring that investors remain ahead of the curve in this evolving market.\nAuthor: Cyril Dujava, Quant Analyst, Quantpedia\nAre you looking for more strategies to read about?

Bitcoin, which surged past the price point of $89,900 (roughly Rs. 75.9 lakhs) earlier this week, saw a minor drop of just over one percent in the last 24 hours. On Wednesday, November 13, Bitcoin's trading value came to $87,382 (roughly Rs. 73.7 lakh) on international exchanges, which showed CoinMarketCap. On Indian exchanges, BTC prices dipped by 2.10 percent. Despite this loss, Bitcoin is trading at $85,987 (roughly Rs. 72.5 lakh).\n“This, for Bitcoin, marks the first downturn since Trump's recent victory, which initially sparked market optimism. Despite this minor setback, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future. The recent volatility is attributed to investor profit-taking, broader market dynamics, and economic uncertainties. According to investors, Bitcoin's foundations are still solid, and there may be further regulatory developments and continued institutional interest,” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\nEther saw bigger losses than Bitcoin on both national as well as international exchanges. Incurring this dip of over four percent, ETH is trading at $3,180 (roughly Rs. 2.68 lakhs) on global exchanges. In India, ETH is priced at $3,117 (roughly Rs. 2.63 lakh), showed the crypto price tracker by Gadgets360.\nTether, Solana, Binance Coin, Dogecoin, USD Coin, Cardano, and Shiba Inu joined BTC and ETH in registering losses.\nCommenting on this slight change in asset prices, Vikram Subburaj, the CEO of Giottus, said these price corrections are natural – but the overall market sentiment is bullish at the moment.\nLeading altcoins such as Solana, Cardano, BNB, and Ethereum have mirrored Bitcoin's slight downturn but have managed to stabilise, showing early signs of recovery on the hourly charts. Weekly gains remain solidly in the double digits. Market sentiment remains bullish, with the Fear and Greed Index climbing to 84, signalling extreme greed,” Subburaj said.\nOwing to market fluctuations, the overall crypto market cap tumbled by 4.12 percent over the last day. As per CoinMarketCap, the overall valuation of the crypto market presently stands at $2.86 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,41,39,115 crore).\nRipple, Tron, and Stellar managed to hold onto minor gains on the price chart.\nAs per Edul Patel, the founder of Mudrex, “Dogecoin is expected to see increased activity as Trump picks Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the Department of Government Efficiency.”\nCryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.

(Nasdaq\/TSX: BITF), a global vertically integrated Bitcoin data center company, reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. All financial references are in U.S. dollars.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms continued to execute its transformational fleet upgrade and executed upon its strategic rebalancing and expansion of its operations in the U.S.\nTo that end, Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIG) (\"Stronghold\"), which is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 with potential for multi-year expansion capacity of up to 1.6 GW. This represents a significant shift of Bitfarms' portfolio towards the U.S., which will come to represent approximately 66% of the Company's total portfolio, an eleven-fold increase from 6% operating power in the U.S. today. Bitfarms has already begun maximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two consecutive hosting agreements totaling 20,000 miners, signed in September and October, supporting approximately 4 EH\/s. Upon close of the Stronghold acquisition, these hosting agreements will revert to self-mining operations.\nThe Company continues to make progress on its fleet upgrade program, deploying 5,400 additional miners during the quarter and achieving its efficiency target of 21 w\/TH three months ahead of schedule. This efficiency represents a 40% improvement year-to-date, reducing direct operating costs per terahash and improving gross margins.\nIn addition, Bitfarms will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain as part of Bitfarms' fleet upgrade program announced last year. Under the agreement, Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH\/s and 15 w\/TH, which represents more than a 20% improvement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms took significant steps to strengthen its leadership team with new hires and a new management structure, providing greater scalability and accountability in data center development and operations, and laying the foundation for the establishment of HPC\/AI operations. Bitfarms also strengthened its corporate governance with the appointment of two new directors and the appointment of the former Lead Director to Independent Chairman. The Bitfarms Board of Directors now consists of five members, four of whom are independent. The Company will hold a Special Meeting on November 20th to vote on an expansion of the Board from five to six members, the nomination of Andrew J. Chang to the Board, and the ratification of the Company's Shareholder Rights Plan.\nIn line with its strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining and maximize the value of its power assets, Bitfarms has selected two U.S. sites for a one to two MW HPC\/AI pilot site. While still early stages, the land and power are secured at both sites, with active conversations taking place with potential partners and suppliers to discuss potential accelerated deployment in 2025. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing terms, plans and budgets as the first step in executing a comprehensive long-term HPC\/AI strategy.\nCFO Jeff Lucas concluded, \"Despite third quarter headwinds of record low hashprices for the Bitcoin mining industry, a 62% year-over-year increase in network difficulty, and the first full quarter following the April Halving Event, our mining operations remained profitable and continued to drive free cash flow. While we achieved our year-end efficiency target of 21 w\/TH in the third quarter, shipping delays and continued miner servicing of our Bitmain T21s impacted our ability to reach 21 EH\/s in 2024. We are working closely with Bitmain on warranty servicing and miner upgrades and expect to reach 21 EH\/s in the first half of 2025.”\n\"As previously communicated, 2024 has been a transformative year for Bitfarms,” stated CEO Ben Gagnon. \"Year-to-date, we've refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners, significantly improving our mining economics, acquired one new site and entered agreements to acquire two additional new sites in the U.S., and completely revamped our operational and Board structure, strengthening our leadership and corporate governance.  We are now uniquely positioned with a strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly half a gigawatt of power infrastructure unallocated with miners. This represents a massive, secured, and cost-effective near-term growth opportunity with the flexibility necessary to maximize shareholder value as we approach the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.”\nQ3 2024 & Recent Operating Highlights\nOperations\nCurrent hashrate of 11.9 EH\/s, up from 10.4 EH\/s in Q2 2024.Averaged 7.6 BTC per day in daily production for Q3 2024. Data Center Portfolio Expansion & Fleet Upgrade\nDeployed 5,400 additional miners across three data centers in Canada, U.S., and Paraguay, for a total of approximately 47,900 miners deployed year-to-date in 2024.Entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which the Company will acquire Stronghold, a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company with operations located in Pennsylvania, in a stock-for-stock merger transaction.Closed the lease agreement in Sharon, Pennsylvania, providing the Company with an immediate capacity of 12 MW of electricity with up to 98 MW of additional development capacity. Bitfarms also signed a letter of intent for a lease to an additional 10 MW site, which would bring total site capacity to 120 MW.Entered into two miner hosting agreements with Stronghold as of October 31, 2024, which will accelerate the deployment of 20,000 miners supporting approximately 4.0 EH\/s.On November 12, 2024, the Company amended its agreements with Bitmain to upgrade the remaining 18,853 Bitmain T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain to superior performing S21 Pro miners. The upgrade will cost an incremental $33.2 million payable in cash or Bitcoin with the option for the Company to redeem the Bitcoin for cash in four quarterly payments based on the price of Bitcoin at the time the Bitcoin is originally tendered.\nPersonnel Appointments & Corporate Updates\nAppointed Ben Gagnon as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO”) and Director of the Board of Directors (\"the Board”), Liam Wilson as Chief Operating Officer, Benoit Gobeil as Chief Infrastructure Officer, Alex Brammer as SVP of Mining Operations, and Rachel Silverstein as U.S. General Counsel.Appointed Amy Freedman as Independent Director of the Board and Lead Director Brian Howlett as Independent Chairman of the Board; accepted the resignations of Nicolas Bonta and Andrés Finkielsztain from the Board.Entered into a settlement agreement with Riot Platforms, Inc. on September 24, 2024Settled the employment dispute with the former CEO.Nominated Andrew Chang for election to the Board at the Special Meeting of Shareholders, taking place on November 20, 2024.\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $45 million, up 8% Q\/Q.Gross mining profit* and gross mining margin* of $17 million and 38%, respectively, down from $21 million and 51% in Q2 2024, respectively.General and administrative expenses of $28 million, up 123% Q\/Q.Operating loss of $44 million, which included $10 million accelerated depreciation on older miners in connection with the transformative fleet upgrade, compared to an operating loss of $24 million in Q2 2024, which included $46 million accelerated depreciation on older miners.Net loss of $37 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share which included a $6 million non-cash gain for revaluation of warrant liabilities in connection with 2023 financing activities.

Browse here.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms continued to execute its transformational fleet upgrade and executed upon its strategic rebalancing and expansion of its operations in the U.S.\nTo that end, Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIG) (“Stronghold”), which is expected to put Bitfarms on track to increase its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by year-end 2025 with potential for multi-year expansion capacity of up to 1.6 GW. This represents a significant shift of Bitfarms’ portfolio towards the U.S., which will come to represent approximately 66% of the Company’s total portfolio, an eleven-fold increase from 6% operating power in the U.S. today. Bitfarms has already begun maximizing the utility of the Stronghold sites with two consecutive hosting agreements totaling 20,000 miners, signed in September and October, supporting approximately 4 EH\/s. Upon close of the Stronghold acquisition, these hosting agreements will revert to self-mining operations.\nThe Company continues to make progress on its fleet upgrade program, deploying 5,400 additional miners during the quarter and achieving its efficiency target of 21 w\/TH three months ahead of schedule. This efficiency represents a 40% improvement year-to-date, reducing direct operating costs per terahash and improving gross margins.\nIn addition, Bitfarms will be upgrading the remaining 18,853 T21 miners to be delivered by Bitmain as part of Bitfarms’ fleet upgrade program announced last year. Under the agreement, Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH\/s and 15 w\/TH, which represents more than a 20% improvement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate.\nDuring the quarter, Bitfarms took significant steps to strengthen its leadership team with new hires and a new management structure, providing greater scalability and accountability in data center development and operations, and laying the foundation for the establishment of HPC\/AI operations. Bitfarms also strengthened its corporate governance with the appointment of two new directors and the appointment of the former Lead Director to Independent Chairman. The Bitfarms Board of Directors now consists of five members, four of whom are independent. The Company will hold a Special Meeting on November 20th to vote on an expansion of the Board from five to six members, the nomination of Andrew J. Chang to the Board, and the ratification of the Company’s Shareholder Rights Plan.\nIn line with its strategy to diversify beyond Bitcoin mining and maximize the value of its power assets, Bitfarms has selected two U.S. sites for a one to two MW HPC\/AI pilot site. While still early stages, the land and power are secured at both sites, with active conversations taking place with potential partners and suppliers to discuss potential accelerated deployment in 2025. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing terms, plans and budgets as the first step in executing a comprehensive long-term HPC\/AI strategy.\nCFO Jeff Lucas concluded, “Despite third quarter headwinds of record low hashprices for the Bitcoin mining industry, a 62% year-over-year increase in network difficulty, and the first full quarter following the April Halving Event, our mining operations remained profitable and continued to drive free cash flow. While we achieved our year-end efficiency target of 21 w\/TH in the third quarter, shipping delays and continued miner servicing of our Bitmain T21s impacted our ability to reach 21 EH\/s in 2024. We are working closely with Bitmain on warranty servicing and miner upgrades and expect to reach 21 EH\/s in the first half of 2025.”\n“As previously communicated, 2024 has been a transformative year for Bitfarms,” stated CEO Ben Gagnon. “Year-to-date, we’ve refreshed nearly our entire fleet of miners, significantly improving our mining economics, acquired one new site and entered agreements to acquire two additional new sites in the U.S., and completely revamped our operational and Board structure, strengthening our leadership and corporate governance.  We are now uniquely positioned with a strategic pipeline of over 950 MW in 2025 with nearly half a gigawatt of power infrastructure unallocated with miners. This represents a massive, secured, and cost-effective near-term growth opportunity with the flexibility necessary to maximize shareholder value as we approach the anticipated 2025 Bitcoin bull cycle.”\nQ3 2024 & Recent Operating Highlights\nOperations\nData Center Portfolio Expansion & Fleet Upgrade\nPersonnel Appointments & Corporate Updates\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\nLiquidity**As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity** of $146 million, comprised of $73 million in cash and 1,147 BTC valued at $73 million based on a BTC price of $63,300 at September 30, 2024.

If Bitcoin\ncontinues to establish itself as a digital asset class and experiences growing\ndemand, it may achieve such values, though this remains speculative and\ncontingent on broader economic and technological changes.\nShare this article","On-chain analyst Willy Woo is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) amid the flagship crypto asset’s rapid advance over the past couple of days.\nWoo tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that while Bitcoin is primed to go higher, the targets that BTC could potentially hit can only be determined by extrapolation.\n“When BTC breaks into all-time highs, there’s no prior history of resistances for the market to trade around. This means price goes into unfettered price discovery, expect wild swings.\nIn these situations, we have two guides to find new resistances. Fibonacci bands, using magic numbers seen in nature, and real liquidation levels of market positions.”\nFibonacci bands is a technical analysis tool that uses the Fibonacci numbers in combination with Bollinger Bands – an indicator used to determine overbought or oversold conditions as well as measuring volatility.\nAccording to Woo, Bitcoin is likely to appreciate by around 16% from the current level after a period of consolidation.\n“$88,000 – $91,000 was the first target. We hit it. Consolidation should happen here. This is both from local Fibonacci levels and liquidation levels where most of the shorts have been taken out, it’s the end of compulsory buying from short sellers getting culled.\n$102,000 is the next macro Fibonacci [level], using last cycle high and this cycle low.

The alert claimed Bitcoin [BTC] had reached an astronomical $110,000. Gemini’s email, sent on the 13th of November, caused both confusion and excitement among users, before it was revealed to be an error.\nWhile the exchange moved quickly to clarify the situation, the incident has reignited discussions about the reliability of alerts and information disseminated by crypto platforms.\nFalse alerts like this can significantly influence investor sentiment, especially in a market as volatile as cryptocurrency. For a brief period, some users may have believed Bitcoin had hit an all-time high, potentially influencing trading decisions based on inaccurate information.\nAlthough Gemini acted swiftly to correct the error, such incidents can erode trust in exchanges and highlight the need for improved systems to ensure accurate communication with users.\nThis isn’t the first time a major crypto platform has made such an error. In 2021, both Coinbase and Crypto.com mistakenly displayed incorrect prices for cryptos on their apps, leading to temporary confusion.\nIn some cases, financial losses for users happen as they act on false information. These incidents underscore how errors in price reporting or alerts can ripple through the market, creating unnecessary volatility or panic among traders.\nWhen an alert like Gemini’s falsely claims that Bitcoin has surged to an unprecedented price, it can lead to irrational decision-making, such as rushed buying or selling. For newer investors, such errors could result in financial losses, further underscoring the importance of accurate data in maintaining market stability and investor confidence.\nGemini’s apology and quick action to address the issue are crucial steps to mitigate potential fallout. However, the incident highlights the broader responsibility of crypto platforms to implement rigorous checks and balances to ensure such errors are minimized.\nWith the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the increasing reliance on exchanges like Gemini crypto for real-time data, ensuring accuracy is more critical than ever.\nRead Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025\nAs the crypto industry evolves, incidents like this serve as reminders of the importance of maintaining trust and transparency in a rapidly changing market. Exchanges must prioritize accuracy to protect investors and foster a stable trading environment for all participants.","Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality\nMorbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\nThe massive Bitcoin (BTC) rally following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election is beginning to show signs of slowing down, particularly in the derivatives market, as evidenced by the leading digital asset’s retreat below the $90,000 mark on Thursday.\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the premium for CME-listed Bitcoin futures contracts—commonly used by institutional investors to speculate on price movements—has decreased, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment.\nK33 Research notes that the basis, or the difference between the futures price and the spot price, has dropped to around 10% after previously hovering between 13% and 16% since the election.\nVetle Lunde, head of research at K33, remarked, “Markets seem to be cooling down… that might have been a subtle hint of moderating risk profiles.” This shift suggests that investors may be reassessing their strategies in light of the recent price volatility.\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at $87,970, down from its all-time high of $93,462 reached just a day ago. Since Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency has seen an increase of over 30%.\nHowever, this rally has been accompanied by significant liquidation of leveraged bullish positions. In the past 24 hours, liquidations of long positions—those betting on price increases—totaled $447 million, compared to $207 million for bearish bets.\nProfit-taking is also contributing to the recent downturn, particularly as Bitcoin approached the $90,000 mark, which has historically been a significant level for open interest in call options.\nJames Davies, CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange, noted, “Crazy speculative days in the market, big profit taking in the last few hours… $90k is a massive level in the call options open interest.”\nThe rally has primarily been fueled by fresh demand in the spot market, evidenced by substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin and relatively moderate leverage among traders.\nInterestingly, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures on offshore exchanges rose after falling earlier in the week, indicating renewed interest among traders after the so-called “Trump trade” catalyst.\nOptions traders are increasingly optimistic, with growing interest in calls with strike prices at $110,000 and $120,000, according to data from Deribit. As Davies commented, “It’s all pure speculative trading right now, expect lots of volatility and a lack of clear signals for a while whilst we wait for policy announcements in the U.S.”\nAs the market approaches the expiry of November options, all eyes will be on whether the $90,000 price point will serve as a resistance level or if Bitcoin can surpass it once again.\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\nRonaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

This is equivalent to 157.5 BTC per day, acquired without the operational costs or capital investments typically associated with bitcoin mining.\n— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) November 12, 2024\nBitcoin rallied above $93,000 on Wednesday as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to notch record highs in the wake of the Nov. 5 elections.

Bernstein noted that there should be a friendlier crypto regulatory environment under Trump, including a new Securities and Exchange Commission Chair.\nAt a crypto conference in July, Trump pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.” Bernstein added that it remains “confident” in its $200,000 bitcoin price target by the end of 2025. Even as bitcoin pushes to record highs, the analysts believe the risk-reward is favorable over the next 12 months. However, new investors should remain cautious about bad actors, wrote Anthony Yeung, global head of strategic development at crypto security firm CoinCover.\n“Bitcoin’s volatility makes it attractive to new investors, but people should take the time to educate themselves around the risks of any bull market,” Yeung wrote. “One of the most important trends that investors should be aware of is the correlation between new market entrants and the rise in malicious activity. With bitcoin expected to rise even further this week, new investors should be particularly wary of these threats.”\nSpot bitcoin ETFs generated $1.93 billion in inflows through Tuesday, led by $1.53 billion from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, according to Farside Investors data.\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was the week’s clear leader with a total of $1.25 billion in inflows.\nSo far, the spot bitcoin ETFs have amassed a total of $27.72 billion in inflows since their January launch, offset by $20.1 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin BTC ETF ranks second at $10.93 billion in inflows. Coinbase stock fell 10.8% on Wednesday and pared gains from Tuesday, after leaping about 20% on Monday.

Robinhood, a crypto-friendly trading app, last week soared 27.4% to 30.54, the highest in nearly three years. Shares surged another 7.4% on Monday, but fell on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin miners rallied on Monday to extend their gains from last week. The stocks were mixed on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Therefore, their listing on SEC-registered exchanges falls outside the CFTC’s jurisdiction, allowing the OCC to handle clearing without CFTC involvement.\nThis is the second major regulatory step for Bitcoin ETFs, following the SEC’s January approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT fund. The ball is now in the OCC’s court, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicting a listing decision “very soon.”\nMarket participants view the addition of options trading as a significant milestone. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, called the delay “entirely unnecessary” and suggested Ethereum ETFs should follow suit without delay. Options are popular among retail traders for speculation and institutions for hedging, which could amplify activity in Bitcoin ETF options markets due to Bitcoin’s strong retail following.\nContrary to concerns about increased volatility, market analyst Dennis Dick argues that options trading can reduce market volatility. By increasing liquidity and creating natural buyers and sellers, options trading could stabilize Bitcoin ETF markets as open interest grows.\nBack in January, the SEC made headlines by approving Bitcoin ETFs to track the cryptocurrency directly, a pivotal moment for both Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Now, several major funds have received approval to offer these options.\nAccording to memos published by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is now able to list and trade options on several Bitcoin-related funds, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Meanwhile, Cboe Global Markets received approval to list options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).\nThis move follows the SEC’s recent approval for Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Many believe this will lead to increased institutional interest in crypto, boosting liquidity and market activity.\nThese options, which allow investors to buy or sell Bitcoin-related assets at a set price within a specific timeframe, are designed to provide institutional investors with a new tool to manage their Bitcoin exposure. This could make investing in Bitcoin more accessible and manageable, particularly for those looking to hedge against market volatility.\nUnit No: BA857 DMCC Business Centre Level No 1 Jewellery & Gemplex 3 Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nInternational House, 10 Admirals Way, London, England, E14 9XL.","Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe recent post-election rally in the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been nothing short of jaw-dropping. In a week, Bitcoin soared by nearly 30% to a new all-time high of $93,434. And we might just be getting started, with some analysts now predicting that Bitcoin could be on the path to $200,000 by the end of 2025.\nNaturally, all this buzz around Bitcoin is bringing in plenty of new investors who are new to crypto. So, if you're one of these new Bitcoin owners, here's all that you need to know about its exponential growth potential in seven easy-to-understand numbers.\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\nIf you're like many investors, you've probably dreamed of becoming a crypto millionaire one day. At Bitcoin's current price of just under $100,000, you'd need to own approximately 10 bitcoins to become a millionaire.\nBut don't let sticker shock hold you back. People buy fractional Bitcoins, not whole Bitcoins. That's because each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units, known as satoshis (named for the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto). So, just as a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis. And that means you can start investing in Bitcoin with just a few dollars.\nFor much of this past decade, Bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets on the planet. This year is no different, with Bitcoin soaring in value by more than 100%. Last year, Bitcoin was up more than 150%.\nThese triple-digit returns are not even out of the ordinary. Consider that, in the period from 2011-2021, Bitcoin delivered annualized returns of 230%. That was far and away the best performance of any asset class. Tech stocks, for example, only delivered annualized returns of 20% during that time period.\nIn crypto circles, investors like to talk about the growth potential of different cryptocurrencies in terms of whether they can increase in price by a factor of 10, 100, or even 1,000. The goal, of course, is to find a high-growth cryptocurrency with 1000x upside potential.\nA decade ago, Bitcoin had 1000x upside potential. In October 2013, Bitcoin traded for just under $100, and many thought that was an impossibly high price for a digital asset. Today, it trades for close to $100,000. So, if you were prescient enough to have spotted Bitcoin's future growth potential a decade ago, you would have seen a 1,000-fold return on your investment.\nOne day that will live forever in Bitcoin lore is known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. This was the first recorded time that Bitcoin was used in a transaction to buy physical goods. On May 22, 2010, a computer programmer in Florida agreed to pay 10,000 bitcoins for two large pizzas from Papa John's (NASDAQ: PZZA).\nAt the time, it seemed like a steal since Bitcoin was practically worthless, and those 10,000 Bitcoins were only worth around $40. Bitcoin had just launched in January 2009, and nobody could have dreamed of how valuable it would eventually become. Today, those 10,000 Bitcoins would be worth close to $1 billion. That's some pretty expensive pizza!\nThe current price for Bitcoin is within striking distance of $100,000, which would represent yet another all-time-high for Bitcoin. While there is admittedly a certain amount of froth and speculation pushing Bitcoin higher, there is also a longer-term investment thesis at work here. Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important part of the global financial system, and this growing adoption on a worldwide scale is what is helping to push Bitcoin higher.\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest shocked the investing world in 2022 when she predicted that Bitcoin could soar in value to $1 million by 2030. To support her thesis, she created a very detailed growth model for Bitcoin, showing how it was gaining in user adoption in several very different areas.\nFor example, Wood correctly predicted that institutional investors would start to make Bitcoin a bigger and bigger part of their overall portfolios. That happened at the start of this year when the new spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading. These ETFs dramatically reduced the complexity and perceived risk of investing in Bitcoin and unlocked a tsunami of new money.\nThere's one more number that you should know as a Bitcoin owner: zero. That's the number of times you should ever sell your Bitcoin. Part of buying Bitcoin is buying it for the long haul. And to do that, you will need to hold on for dear life (HODL).\nThat's because volatility is very high for this cryptocurrency, and every few years, it experiences a dramatic drawdown in value. In fact, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has documented at least five different periods in the history of Bitcoin when it has declined in value by 77% or more. So, be prepared for some turbulence ahead.\nAt the end of the day, Bitcoin's impressive upside potential sets it apart from other asset classes. While Bitcoin might not hit a price of $1 million for years to come, it is increasingly going mainstream and deserves a closer look for your investment portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

If you call up a chart, this isn’t speculative. You call up a chart Bitcoin over gold, Bitcoin has crushed gold on face-peeling volatility. So that makes sense.\nBitcoin has a higher stock-to-flow ratio, it has an energy tie like gold does and Bitcoin has a growing network effect. As long as that growing network effect continues, then I don’t see any reason that that would change regardless of whether administrative continues or not.”\nThe stock-to-flow model (S2F), traditionally used for commodities, predicts the performance of an asset based on the idea that the price increases as the asset becomes more scarce. Bitcoin has a higher S2F ratio than gold due to halving events, when BTC miner rewards are cut in half, reducing the number of new coins hitting the market.\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $90,593, up nearly 2% on the day.\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\nCheck Price Action\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Some experts predict a Nasdaq debut as early as November 19th.\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented that the notice implies it is “a matter of when, not if” these crypto investment vehicles will launch. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been eagerly anticipated for their direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, making them attractive for institutional and retail investors.\nThe introduction of options trading for these ETFs would further enhance their appeal. It allows sophisticated market participants to hedge risk, speculate on price movements, and manage portfolios more precisely.\nThe potential launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options trading is expected to significantly impact Bitcoin’s market dynamics. By providing a regulated and accessible avenue for investment, these ETFs could attract institutional investors who have hesitated to engage with cryptocurrencies.\nPrimarily due to regulatory uncertainty or operational challenges. Options trading adds another layer of sophistication, enabling institutions to deploy advanced strategies that were previously limited to traditional asset classes.\nThis development is likely to drive increased liquidity in the Bitcoin market, reducing volatility and fostering a more stable trading environment.\nAs institutional participation grows, the perceived legitimacy of Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset is expected to strengthen. This could also encourage further adoption across industries.\nMoreover, the availability of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for additional financial products tied to digital assets. These include futures and derivatives. This expanding ecosystem would offer more diverse opportunities for investors, solidifying Bitcoin’s position within global financial markets.\nRead Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025\nThe impending launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options trading marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These investment vehicles could usher in a new era of institutional adoption and market growth.","eToro, which offers both CFDs and physical crypto trading, revealed to Finance Magnates that the total value of the newly opened Bitcoin positions jumped by more than 300% in the first two weeks of November compared to the first two weeks of October. While the volume of crypto CFDs on Pepperstone also jumped over 3 times after the US elections, Axi confirmed doubling its figures.\nFor both Pepperstone and Axi, the crypto market rally induced by Donald Trump's victory as the 47th president of the United States only boosted the already growing demand for crypto trading on their platforms.\nPepperstone, an Australia-headquartered broker, revealed that its client trading volumes were already increasing into the US election. Axi, on the other hand, experienced a notable volume increase before the US election, from a daily average of over $448 million to more than $892.6 million, representing a 99.23% rise. Following November 10th, volumes further increased by 92% and have remained elevated since then.\nIt should be noted that eToro's figures combine its CFDs and physical crypto offerings. However, the figures for Pepperstone and Axi are only for crypto CFDs.\nThe open positions on all these platforms also jumped significantly, along with the volume. The number of crypto CFDs positions on Axi increased by up to 13 times compared to pre-US election levels. eToro, which only provided data for open positions for Bitcoin, also witnessed a jump of over 170%.\n“[The figures show] that more investors were buying Bitcoin and in much larger amounts,” said eToro’s Crypto Analyst, Simon Peters, adding that “the number of positions closed also rose 100% as investors took profit.”\nAccording to Axi’s Chief Commercial Officer, Louis Cooper, the increase in crypto positions “reflects a clear trend of investors seeking diversification amid uncertainty surrounding traditional asset classes.”\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency with the volatility. In fact, some other altcoins, especially meme tokens, remained more volatile than Bitcoin.\n\"We’ve seen some interest in Dogecoin, and Cardano and some of the other coins that have undergone such incredible price shifts since 5 November, however, client activity remains heavily skewed towards Bitcoin,\" said Chris Weston, Head of Research at Pepperstone.\n\"Clients are always drawn to increased movement in any market, and while we’ve seen 100%+ moves in the likes of Dogecoin, clients have still been treated to an impulsive rally in Bitcoin, with price gaining 40% post-election. With the leverage offered in crypto CFDs, many don’t necessarily feel the need to push into Doge, as Bitcoin has the movement, the superior liquidity and lower cost to trade (spreads), to effectively trade their strategy.\"\nFurthermore, Pepperstone’s long (vs short) net positioning skew in Bitcoin and crypto is rarely below 70%. While the broker pay 10% on swaps on short positions (held over rollover), its traders are still highly biased to implement strategies that capture upside potential in price.\n\"Bitcoin and crypto CFDs are geared towards capturing short-term two-way trading opportunities,\" Weston added, \"and as such, we’ve started to see a shift and an increase in traders turning more aggressive and shorting Bitcoin above $90k – with the broadly held thesis that price has run a little too hot, and the band has been pulled too hard, and due to mean revert. However, momentum and trend strategies have been the clear preference, and clients have been attracted to the increased range expansion and strength in the price.\"\nWhile Axi also observed the usual trend of clients buying and holding, which is expected with Trump coming into office, Cooper added: “There is a notable increase in two-way flow, with many clients choosing to go against the trend, resulting in balanced activity of buying and selling. This indicates a more dynamic trading environment where clients actively manage positions amid evolving market conditions.”\n“Conversely, there has been a shift towards longer holding periods for equities, particularly in the technology and energy sectors. The current environment seems to be driving a 'barbell strategy,' where investors are actively trading high-risk assets like crypto while holding onto equity positions that are likely to benefit from Trump’s pro-business policies.”\nThe fiat value of Bitcoin reached a record high last week, fuelled by Trump’s pro-crypto stance. It peaked at $93,400 against the US dollar and trades above $91,500 as of press time.\nDemand came from both retail and institutional investors. Michael Saylor-chaired MicroStrategy again poured billions into Bitcoin at its peak value.\nAs for retail investors, eToro’s Peters said, “Globally, we are also seeing more people register to join eToro and fund their accounts.” For Axi, the surge in clients actively trading cryptocurrencies since the US elections marked a 200% increase.\n“This growth highlights the appeal of cryptocurrencies as a speculative asset class, particularly among retail investors looking to capitalise on the latest bull cycle,” added Cooper.\nPreviously, Finance Magnates reported that crypto CFD trading demand on Axi last March reached $16.7 billion, compared to $7.6 billion in January and $10.4 billion in February.\nPepperstone's Weston also highlighted that the the broker has seen a strong strong interest from prospects and a clear uplift in new client accounts in recent weeks, \"which has resulted in significant volume and flow.\"\n\"I’m not sure how much of that one can attribute to the US election, as most traders I’ve spoken to couldn’t wait for it to be over,\" he added. \"What matters most is that cross-market price action, range expansion, and volatility have become highly favourable for short-term traders and the general trading environment has seen increased opportunity for traders of all strategies (momentum, swing, mean reversion etc) to cut their craft in.\"\nRania Gule, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com, another broker offering crypto CFDs, also acknowledged the overall rise in crypto trading demand but did not share platform-specific figures.\n“Post-election, there’s been a noticeable change in trading behaviour,” said Gule. “Specifically, users are more inclined towards a buy-and-hold strategy for cryptocurrencies while showing a preference for active stock trading. This indicates a growing interest in crypto as a long-term investment asset, while stocks remain a go-to for shorter-term moves.”\nAlthough higher trading activities translate to more revenue for trading platforms, which often charge through spreads, a sudden surge in volume also brings challenges. One key challenge is the load on the trading infrastructure and the limited time to address it.\n“With the increased demand for crypto trading, operational challenges have naturally arisen,” Cooper said. “The heightened trading volumes have required us to expand server capacity to ensure platform stability during peak times. We’ve also increased our customer support resources to accommodate the uptick in new users and the associated inquiries regarding crypto trading.”\n“Additionally, managing liquidity has become a priority, particularly with the heightened volatility in the market. With more flow and demand for crypto trading, we have had to ensure that we provide the best possible price for our clients. This has resulted in significant work sourcing, onboarding, and testing new liquidity providers in the crypto space to maintain tight spreads and ensure efficient trade execution, even during volatile periods, ultimately enhancing the trading experience for our clients.”\nHowever, eToro, which is also planning to go public, denied facing any challenges with the surge in crypto trading demand.\nPepperstone also did not witnessed any challenges, as Weston highlighted that its \"systems have handled the increased flow with ease,\" adding: \"Client fills when executing at market or on market orders have been well received and helped by the extended hours to trade Bitcoin\/crypto that limits the gapping risk, while the intraday price action has also been smooth.\"\neToro, which offers both CFDs and physical crypto trading, revealed to Finance Magnates that the total value of the newly opened Bitcoin positions jumped by more than 300% in the first two weeks of November compared to the first two weeks of October.

On its first trading day, the options recorded an impressive $1.9 billion in trading volume, which contributed significantly to Bitcoin's price surge.\nEdul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, said, “Bitcoin rallied to a fresh all-time high of $94,000, driven by the debut of the first Bitcoin ETF options. However, profit-taking following the peak has pulled BTC back to its current level of $92,000. Bitcoin now faces resistance at $94,600, with support holding steady at $90,400.”\nAdding to the excitement, reports emerged that Donald Trump’s media company is considering acquiring Bakkt, a prominent crypto trading firm. This has sparked optimism among investors about a potentially crypto-friendly environment in the future.\n“The introduction of options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust marks a turning point in Bitcoin's journey. It highlights growing institutional interest and provides investors with more ways to gain exposure to the asset. Bitcoin’s recent rally signals a broader shift towards mainstream adoption,\" said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX.INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST DRIVES ADOPTION\nThe latest surge in Bitcoin prices also reflects growing institutional interest in the asset. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor recently announced plans to propose Bitcoin as part of Microsoft’s treasury strategy, citing its potential to improve financial stability and mitigate risk.\nMeanwhile, the altcoin market witnessed mixed trends. A brief rally in memecoins was overshadowed by market corrections following Bitcoin’s pullback from its peak.\nThe developments also align with rising tensions in global markets. Escalating geopolitical issues, such as the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, have prompted investors to turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against uncertainty.FUTURE OUTLOOK\nDespite the record-breaking performance, market analysts caution about potential volatility in the near term. Profit-taking activity has already begun, and Bitcoin prices have seen minor corrections.\n“Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, with strong resistance at $94,600 and support at $90,400,” said Patel. “While the price rally is promising, investors should remain cautious as the market adjusts to these significant developments.”\n(Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts\/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group.

Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.\nBitcoin has shattered records again, reaching a new all-time high of $97,903 just hours ago. The cryptocurrency market is exciting as Bitcoin leads the charge, delivering explosive gains that have fueled widespread bullish sentiment. Investors and traders alike speculate this rally is far from over, with Bitcoin edging closer to the monumental $100,000 mark.\nKey data from Coinglass reveals another significant milestone: Bitcoin’s Open Interest has reached an all-time high. This surge in Open Interest indicates a flood of capital entering the market, signaling heightened activity and confidence among traders. Such metrics further confirm the euphoric state of the market, where optimism reigns supreme and momentum continues to build.\nWith Bitcoin’s price rallying at an unprecedented pace and market indicators hitting record levels, the stage is set for what many believe to be an almost inevitable breakout above the psychological $100,000 level. The market’s focus is whether BTC can sustain its trajectory or if a temporary pullback will precede the next leg up. Either way, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin as it cements its status as the leading force in this explosive bull run.\nGreed has gripped the Bitcoin market, with the average Fear and Greed Index hitting 76%, signaling heightened optimism among investors. This elevated level of greed suggests that market participants are buying aggressively, anticipating that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trajectory without significant setbacks. Such sentiment often leads to increased speculative behavior as traders look to capitalize on the ongoing rally.\nCritical data from Coinglass supports this narrative, revealing that Bitcoin Open Interest—representing the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—has reached an all-time high of $62.69 billion.\nThis unprecedented figure highlights the speculative nature of the current market, as traders use leveraged instruments like futures to amplify their potential gains. While this fuels bullish momentum, it also adds volatility, making the market susceptible to sharp moves in either direction.\nInterestingly, Bitcoin’s optimistic environment starkly contrasts the broader crypto market, where altcoins continue to struggle to reclaim yearly highs. While BTC leads the charge with record-breaking performance, altcoins have yet to catch up, underscoring Bitcoin’s dominance during this market cycle phase.\nAs speculative activity and investor optimism drive Bitcoin’s price action, the market waits to see if the rally has more fuel or if a correction looms. For now, Bitcoin remains the focal point of this euphoric bull run.\nBitcoin is trading at $97,500 after setting a fresh all-time high, continuing its explosive rally. The market leader has entered price discovery—a phase often characterized by parabolic trends like the one currently driving BTC higher. Investor anticipation is growing, with the $100,000 mark only 2.5% away.\nThis psychological milestone could act as significant resistance, potentially holding Bitcoin down for an extended period. A consolidation phase around this level would benefit the broader market, allowing altcoins to catch up and the rally to maintain stability.\nHowever, price discovery can be unpredictable. If Bitcoin fails to reach the $100,000 mark in the coming days, the market could see a pullback as bullish momentum cools. A retrace to lower demand zones, such as the $88,500 level, would provide the market with a necessary reset before the next leg upward.\nDespite the possibility of a short-term correction, Bitcoin’s price action remains strong. Its dominance over the crypto market and the current euphoric sentiment suggest bulls are still firmly in control. As traders and investors closely monitor price movements, Bitcoin’s ability to push through key psychological levels will determine the next phase of this historic rally.\nFeatured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView\nSebastian's journey into the world of crypto began four years ago, driven by a fascination with the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize financial systems.

The cryptocurrency is up 5% in the last 24 hours and has gained an impressive 43% over the past 16 days since November 5. The momentum shows no signs of slowing as BTC price continues its steady ascent. Several key factors are driving this remarkable rally:\nFollowing Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, market sentiment has shifted significantly. The initial “Trump trade” has evolved into the “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade,” fueled by speculation that President-elect Trump may establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This follows his pledge at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville.\nIndustry insiders like David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a Trump campaign advisor, and Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, have hinted at the possibility of the SBR becoming a reality. Both have urged that the SBR be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency through an executive order. They warn of the United States potentially falling behind in the global race to accumulate BTC.\nBailey revealed on November 9, “There is at least one nation-state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” He emphasized his certainty with a meme, indicating his information is based on knowledge rather than speculation. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, confirmed in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that “countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes.”\nThe “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade” is expected to continue until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his promises, potentially moving over 208,000 BTC confiscated by law enforcement into the reserve or even adopting Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act proposal to purchase 1 million BTC over five years.\nA leak on Wednesday suggests that President-elect Trump’s team is in discussions about creating a new White House position dedicated solely to Bitcoin and crypto policy. Sources familiar with the transition efforts indicate that candidates are being vetted for this role.\nIf established, it would be the first-ever Bitcoin and crypto-specific White House position, underscoring the influence the nascent industry stands to wield in the incoming administration. It is unclear whether the role will be a senior White House staff position or a “crypto czar” overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government. Crypto industry advocates are pushing for the role to have a direct line to Trump – a massive news for the entire industry.\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has had a significant impact on the market. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) ETF options, launched on November 19, 2024, saw an unprecedented $1.9 billion in notional exposure on their first day of trading. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart stated, “Final tally of IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new Bitcoin all-time highs today.”\nJeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, recently highlighted the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options:\nWith the approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside ‘vol’ of ‘vol’ in financial history. For the first time, Bitcoin’s notional value will be ‘fractionally banked’ with ETF options. This marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market.\nPark explained that Bitcoin ETF options provide a regulated market where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects clearing members from counterparty risks, allowing Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. He emphasized that this could lead to an explosive recursive effect on Bitcoin’s price due to unique volatility characteristics and the “volatility smile.”\nIf there were one thing to read today re the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options, read (and bookmark) this one for 2025 – it’s going to be wild. pic.twitter.com\/On2DmUsbHX\n— Jeff Park (@dgt10011) September 20, 2024\nThe latest rally has also been driven by significant activity in the spot market. Heavy spot bids have propelled the price higher, with yesterday’s BTC ETF inflows being a crucial factor. Inflows amounted to $773.4 million, with BlackRock contributing $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million, Bitwise $9.2 million, and ARK Invest $3.8 million. Over the past three days, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased a staggering $1.856 billion worth of Bitcoin.\nGood morning,\nYesterday’s Bitcoin ETF flows were positive for $773.4 million.\nBlackrock did $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million.

Man regresses into his most primitive on the fervent instinct to accumulate wealth. The dualities of his intentions shall rise to surface his true character.\nEditor’s note: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Cryptocurrencies are speculative, complex, and involve high risks. This can mean high prices volatility and potential loss of your initial investment. You should consider your financial situation, investment purposes, and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The HackerNoon editorial team has only verified the story for grammatical accuracy and does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the information stated in this article. #DYOR\nUp and to the right.“ But Sir; physics says its not possible.”“ Who is “Physics” and why are you listening to him?”Up only I said.\nPrices are rising,Cults are forming,New narratives are capturing attention.\nAnd retail is only starting to arrive now.\nThings are about to get wild.Very wild.\nWAGMI, they say.Supercycle, they say.This time, it's different, they say.\nAs we accelerate upwards through explosive\/chaotic market expansions that allow us to enjoy the onset of fresh liquidity driven by FOMO, we shall bear witness to the intellectual atrophy of the industry’s subject matter(s). The quality, depth, and honesty of content will recede as soulless conversations about price take front and center.\nGamified, “funny”, socially cognizant, and absent of liability, this cycle's domineering theme of Memecoins is an apocryphal example of the double-edged dualities and paradoxes of web3.\nWhile these wonderful, retail-oriented instruments have done (and continue to do)amazing things for the industry, such as:- blessing us with glorious double, triple, and even quadruple-digit returns- bringingsoulback into the industry by acting as a counterbalance to the ETF\/tradfi crowds- embodying the purest realizations of crypto\/blockchain’s innate power*(borderlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance, opposition against “Goliath”)*\nThey simultaneously bring with them a behavioral virus…\nBelligerent greed driving manic levels of grifting.Vaporware heralded as a new paradigm.New millionaires popping up daily.\nThe delicate social thread of attention upon which the memecoin market hinges forces market participants to resort to extreme measures. Provocative marketing, eclectic branding, and traumatizing market-making; whatever it takes to trigger intense emotional responses that capture that very scarce and erratic resource of attention. This is a very steep, slippery slope leading to moral and psychological deterioration, especially when factoring in that prolonged exposure to the sector’s toxic, demoralizing culture of degeneracy and low IQs skews perspectives and incentivizes malicious behavior (scamming).\nRegardless, when measuring industry growth over time, not just “Top-to-Top” but also “Bottom-to-Bottom,” Memecoins are a huge positive for the industry.\nPossibly as a result of the “knock-on” effect, where simply due to the egregious amount of volume, some degree of liquidity permanently spills over into adjacent areas such as infrastructure and DEFI where it will increase the baseline, or into the portfolios of diamond handed veterans, which will reliably continue to steer the development of this industry.\nWhen prices are flying and emotions are high, our job is to enjoy the ride as much as possible while always remaining grounded.\nThe best way to do that is by taking a moment to look at the big picture.\nTo remember the deeply philosophical foundations upon which this industry was born and upon which it continues to blossom… The existential distrust in government and elegance of the human psyche.\nNothing is personal.\nNature does not discriminate or play favorites.\nIt explicitly indicates that intelligence will always optimize for energy efficiency, and over time, all resources will flow there where they require the least effort and produce the most effect.\nIn the case of human attention and capital resources, this environment is a decentralized one.\nThe diffusion of control\/authority over a system from a single source to many.\nPromising to radically transform the economic fabric of society through the synthesis of cryptographic, economic, and social primitives, Blockchain technology (namely Bitcoin) captured the imaginations of a very small, special circle of people known as cypherpunks back in 2009–11.\nWitnessing the exponential technological developments in computer science while living through the dotCom and GFC bubbles, these people were united and incentivized by their belief in technology as a natural extension of human rights and self-sovereignty.\nHard-coded and isolated from politics, Bitcoin was the perfect instrument to transform power structures, circumvent government oppression, and rehypothecate value.\nAn alternative monetary regime,Governed by all,Owned by none.\nTo stand against Big Brother.\nFirst, it was an idea that was dismissed.Then, a working product that was laughed off as a toy.Then, a threat to governments that was harped on and revolted against.Today, it is the cornerstone around which modern finance is coordinating.\nBy lowering the barrier to entry, abstaining from the enforcement of arbitrary social laws, and detaching from the confines of geographic borders, we equalize opportunity and open up the playing field.\nEconomics are massive social emperiments, always have been, always will be.\nThe premier application of Blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, is a tokenized unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. Digitally native money that is cryptographically secured.\nWe won't go too deep here, but money is an abstract concept that acts as a vehicle to simplify and facilitate the measurement and exchange of value between people. You acquire it by exchanging your most scarce and precious resources, time, energy, and knowledge for the resolution of people's problems\/creation of solutions rather than on yourself. For your contributions, society rewards you with resources that allow you to experience something else. It is stored energy that signifies acquisition through the expansion of effort over time in the pursuit of a desirable outcome.\nCrypto’s esoteric money-like nature pushed humanity into challenging the status quo and reconsidering what value truly is and how it is ascribed.\nAfter public disillusionment from the surfacing of truths around conspiracy theories, governmental corruption schemes, and blatant economic manipulation collided with the arrival of blockchain technology, a revolution began.\nIndividuals gathered to build digital communities comparable in size and influence to nation-states to declare economic emancipation by naming decentralized crypto networks’ computational resources (coins) to be valid, alternative, independent forms of value.\nFast forward 10 years, and in addition to the radical new class of wealthy people rising around the world, cryptocurrency birthed an entirely new sector based on an alternative monetary system.\nThe impact of crypto’s innate technical primitives of sovereignty, borderlessness, accountability, interoperability, and divisibility naturally apply to and extend the utility of money. By decreasing transactional friction while increasing security, cryptocurrency unlocked the concept of superfluid finance.\nNearly, if not all, applications and institutions have either already integrated or have shown intent to integrate crypto\/blockchain into their operations. From payment megacorps such as Cashapp, PayPal, Transferwise, and Moneygram reducing costs and settlement times with stablecoins; to wealth managers like BlackRock catering ETFs to their legacy clients, to enterprises like MicroStrategy building reserves on their balance sheet; the list of experimentation is limitless.\nCrypto has seeped so deep into society that we no longer bat an eye at the fact that ETFs hold over 5.8% of Bitcoin's total supply or that government ownership is over 2.5%. Over the last 3+ years, El Salvador incessantly added 1 $BTC to its reserves every single day. Today, with ~5,750 BTC (~0.027% total), it ranks as the 6th largest country to hold $BTC. It could be coincidental, but governments, including Dubai, Singapore, Russia, Brazil, Sudi, and others, have been pushing crypto-friendly policies and, in turn, drawing in capital, residency, tourism, or otherwise flourishing.\nStablecoins hold over $120 Billion or >2.5% of US Government Treasuries. Tether (USDt) is the 16th largest holder of US government debt in the world, accounting for over $105 Billion. Circle (USDc) is sitting at $31 Billion worth of USTs\/REPOs. MakerDAO (DAI) holds over $1.2B.\nIt's crazy when we realize that these numbers will continue to go up.\nIt's almost poetic, that the technology they so vehemently fought against turned out to be exactly the remedy they needed most. From polar oppositions wanting to tear each other down to a mutually beneficial partnership building each other up.\nRarely discussed anymore, but well-known is the super-symmetric alignment of crypto as a technology with the fundamental forces governing human life.\nDesigns of economic systems are logically rooted in the physical laws of thermodynamics. Energy cannot be created; it can only be transferred — crypto does not randomly create money; it simply packages it. Over time, entropy pushes atomic life to chaos —  the more decentralized something becomes, the more challenging\/messy the coordination. Finally, how temperature overlaps with social interest is mindboggling; markets get “hot” when new people\/capital resources enter and “cold” when interest leaves; flux is necessary for a harmonious existence.\nThe philosophic rabbit hole runs insanely deep.\nRather than having me rehash the biblical volumes of cosmic implications that cryptocurrency has on the fabric of society; the most effective way to stumble upon that profound existential coincidence is to DYOR.\nTrust, But Verify.\nUnderneath the hood of this economic revolution, the actual technology powering cryptocurrency, blockchain, is not all that sexy. It is an intellectually dense technology rooted in the subject matters of cryptography, distributed computation, game theory, mathematics, and so much more.\nBlockchains are data clouds that store and process information in a structured way according to criteria involving sequencing, speed, reliability, security, finality, etc.\nThrough an intricate weaving of asymmetric-key cryptography, byzantine fault tolerance, hashing, zero-knowledge proofs, message-passing protocols, and a suite of other computational innovations, blockchains provide a systematic framework that transformed data structures from CRUD to CRU.\nBy removing the ability to delete information, history became immutable. It was now possible to track and record the state of and progression of information.\nCoupling this with its open, distributed nature, we arrive at the big tangible breakthrough that blockchain technology has on society: a tamperproof digital ledger that records data in an autonomous, transparent, and reliable way — the birthplace of triple-entry accounting.\nReduce\/Remove Error.Maximize Accuracy.Streamline Processes.\nLiterally, it is the perfect mixture of traits for a digital fabric of trust. No wonder it is colloquially referred to as the “engine of trust.”\nIts application is only limited to imagination.\nProving provenance in physical supply chains.\nIncreasing certainty of an object's authenticity by tracing its originating source while reducing\/removing counterfeits has done wonders for collector markets such as wine, art, shoes, watches, trading cards, and luxury goods.\nProving provenance for informational supply chains.\nThe IOT (Internet-Of-Things) industry is very fragile and vulnerable to manipulation around the edges. Sensors must stream information about their environmental state, and there are a multitude of natural variables that can corrupt this stream. Making sure that there is a consistent, honest set of information building this state requires the “consensus-related” functions of a blockchain to detect and deter malfunctions.\nTime Stamping.\nThe block height of a chain can be used as an alternative measure of the progression of time. By adding an extra layer of validation, in the form of a a blockchain’s block number, we can track series, such as the processes of signing documentation, releasing a newspaper, recording a video, etc.\nSocial Media Networks.\nIncentivized, bot-free, censorship-resistant, unhackable environments that preserve user privacy, rehypothecate de-platforming risks, grant users ownership through utilization and engage in governance. Potential order of magnitude improvement and the powerful wealth effect of transposing the value of the Social Media industry from a single centralized corporation to its million\/billion user base.\nDigital Identities.\nPortable, platform-independent, proofs-of-humanity. An esoteric concept, identity was, is, and will be one of the most important applications of blockchain. Being able to freely travel across borders and not fear citizenship revocation.\nManaging Autonomous Agents.\nThis element is two-fold. Internally, blockchains can be integrated into the operating systems of the AI themselves, to ensure that these agents are kept maximally aligned with protocol and unable to game the system. Externally, assuming crypto really is the defacto digital financial instrument for a hybrid human\/AI economy, then blockchains would protect the systems with which they interact. AI will always find the most optimal paths, and those will always be the ones void of artificial barricades.\nCrypto and blockchain have secured their roles across a multitude of industries {pharma tracking, timestamping, finance, science research, et al.} and became permanent\/irreplaceable elements that will persist alongside the advancement of all technologies moving forward.\nOut of Sight, Out of Mind.\nSociety exists in a wave-like flux of trends.\nSomething is generally only considered important if it is loud, grandiose, and\/or in your face.\nSemiconductors are a component of literally every single electronic device. Tiny, microscopic things we don't even think about, but without which, we would not have the technology that we do, nor its associated blossoming $680 Billion dollar industry.  While we may occasionally take antibiotics, we rarely consciously process the value that this innovation has brought to society.\nSince the discovery of penicillin, the average human lifespan extended by 20 years because previously lethal bacteria could now be dealt with. Talk about impact.\nIn the rapidly evolving world of technology, there is a select range of technologies that dominate the conscious due to them, in some way, shape, or form, applying to\/measurably touching every industry and facet of human life.\nQuantum Computing, AI, Blockchain, Cryptography, Robotics, 3D printing, VR\/AR, IoT, Laser Surgery, Renewable Energy, Nanobots, and a few others.\nMost of these technologies and their correlating science(s) are actually pretty sexy. They carry a visceral, innate association in our minds composed of sci-fi fantasies and well-spun narratives from theoreticians.\nBlockchains and cryptography… not so much.\nPerhaps the mother of all tech trends, the be-all-end-all point of computer science, singularity, whatever you want to call it, is AI. Going through rigorous cycles of hyperbolic exuberance flares and prolonged, ice-cold winters since its inception in the early 1950s, AI has experienced exponential improvements while public ideologies remained largely the same. Skynet. Matrix. Terminator.\nEven though I undoubtedly believe that in a future where man and machine synthesize and share autonomy, I personally do not believe that the current iteration of \"AI\" is anywhere near the stage people assume\/speculate that it is in. Powerful narratives and well-executed coordination among sophisticated entities have blasted this subject into the stratosphere of public consciousness and drawn attention from everything else. ***Disclaimer: it is possible I am midcurving this one.\nEvery institution, sovereign, nation-state, enterprise, VC, startup, and software tool is howling at the moon in attempts to get an edge over the other guy to show the world how innovative\/special they are. So prevalent is the AI narrative that it has bled into all adjacent technologies, boosting them individually and further diverting attention from them.\nNo need to look far. When discounting memecoins, AI is actually the hottest sector of Crypto with the greatest growth and returns this cycle. There are even AI memecoins that are printing quadruple-digit gains and forming new cults daily.\nHowever, when times get tough or the \"next best thing\" hits the markets, our industry loses its appeal. If prices are not going up, then it's not worth the mindshare. Unwinds of over 90% during bear markets are standard.\nIt's as if the power to be economically independent from governments suddenly provides less value.\nIf retention was higher and  users\/use cases were stickier, would these unwinds potentially lose some of the severity, and cycle times would compress? Is any one technology more important than the other? Is this sustainable? Maybe. Maybe not. This is left to greater forces. For society to judge and time to prove.\nThe human experience is transient; what is here today was not here 500 years ago, and will likely not be here in the next 500.\nThe Best way to predict future, is to create it.\nHuman life is like a star looping, drawing circles; time is a 4th-dimensional force that propels the loop into a vacuum. Thus, the human experience is reminiscent of spirals, both on the individual and group levels. Whenever loops have points of overlap, people tend to say that \"life may not always repeat itself, but it sure does often rhyme.\"\nSometimes, in the daily hustle and bustle of human life, we get absorbed in our own microcosms and forget about the infinite wisdom of the external world tucked into the crevices of history.\nWe forget that seasons change.\nThat trends will come and go.\nThat crypto will continue to grow.\nRegardless of what inflation in the US might be or what the spot price of Solana is, the sun will shine, the grass will grow, and every 600 seconds, a new block will be appended to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nBut honestly, when you’re up 3,141% on a shitcoin, all this zen stuff doesn't fu*king matter.\nWhen I got into crypto, it was the time of underground, anti-establishment revolution; when the content was scarce, subject matter experts were basically non-existent, and conversations around privacy as a fundamental human right and code as a form of free speech (to protect it with the First Amendment) dominated the chatrooms.\nYes, of course, money was important, but it was only an instrument to measure how effective this revolution was, a natural byproduct of its truth. I was purely \"In it for the tech.\"\nOr so I told myself.\nAfter multiple cycles of absolute financial obliteration and self-reflection, it was obvious that the Narrative hooked me, and the price action kept me.\nA rising tide lifts all ships, and Everybody is a genius in a bull market.\nAs you experience an influx of great wealth, it's easy to detach from reality.\nAlways keep in mind the humbling reality of nature's cyclicality.\n\" Hard Times create Strong Men,\nStrong Men create Good Times\nGood Times create Weak Men\nWeak men create Hard Times \"\nWhere will you be in 2 years?\nLive Long 💎\n& Prosper Anon\nI'll see you on-chain🥂"]}

Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH], the largest altcoin was down by 1.39% to trade at $3,383 at press time.\nBesides a surge in volatility, which is often seen during the weekends due to low trading volumes, several other factors also caused the price decline.\nData from Coinglass shows that in just 24 hours, the total liquidations across the crypto market reached $489 million. These liquidations affected more than 186,000 traders.\nTraders with leveraged long positions suffered the biggest blow, with more than $360 million being wiped out. Bitcoin recorded $56 million in liquidations, marking the largest single-day long liquidations on BTC in over a week.\nAt the same time, Ethereum and Dogecoin [DOGE] saw the highest liquidations among altcoins, with $32 million and $21 million being wiped out, respectively.\nSource: Coinglass\nWhenever long traders are liquidated, they are forced to close their positions through selling. Therefore, this scenario fuelled the recent downturn.\nAs aforementioned, weekends are usually associated with low trading volumes. Due to this, a slight uptick in buying or selling activity can have a significant impact on price.\nData from CryptoQuant shows that in the last three days, more than 74,000 BTC have been moved to spot exchanges. These inflows suggest that some traders are keen on taking profits after the recent gains.\nSource: CryptoQuant\nMoreover, out of this amount, around 19,238 BTC was deposited to exchanges over the weekend. Possible selling activity after these deposits might have fuelled a downtrend in Bitcoin prices and subsequently, altcoins.\nDespite the recent correction, the market sentiment remains bullish. This is seen in the Fear and Greed Index with a value of 82, showing “extreme greed.”\nWhile this metric shows that traders are highly optimistic and confident, it can also hint at an upcoming correction or trend reversal. Therefore, traders should watch out for signs of intense profit-taking, as that could fuel further dips.","ByTonya M. Evans\nByTonya M.

Amidst the volatility lies a powerful tool to optimize your portfolio and reduce your crypto tax burden: tax-loss harvesting. Whether you're a seasoned trader or a crypto-curious newcomer, understanding how to leverage this strategy can make a significant impact on your financial outcomes.\nThis guide will demystify the process of tax-loss harvesting in the crypto space, breaking down the mechanics, key considerations and actionable strategies you can use to confidently navigate this technique in today’s evolving regulatory landscape. By the end, you’ll be equipped to turn market downturns into opportunities for growth—all while staying compliant with tax laws.\nBefore diving into tax loss harvesting, it is important to understand transactions that might trigger a taxable event. Cryptocurrency transactions that trigger taxes include selling digital assets for fiat currency, trading one cryptocurrency for another (e.g., BTC to ETH), and using crypto to purchase goods or services. Even receiving cryptocurrency from mining or forks is considered taxable. However, buying crypto with fiat, gifting it, donating to a tax-exempt organization, or transferring assets between personal wallets are generally non-taxable. Recognizing these distinctions helps investors effectively plan and execute tax-loss harvesting strategies, ensuring compliance while minimizing taxable income.\nHowever, not all cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, and these exemptions play a critical role in tax planning. For example, transferring crypto between wallets you own is not a taxable event, making it irrelevant for tax-loss harvesting. Similarly, gifting crypto or donating to a qualified tax-exempt organization avoids triggering taxes, potentially lowering overall tax burdens. These exempt actions are important for investors looking to manage portfolios strategically while staying compliant with IRS rules, particularly during volatile market periods that encourage asset reallocation.\nTax-loss harvesting is a tax-efficient investing strategy designed to offset capital gains from profitable investments with losses from underperforming assets. In the cryptocurrency space, where volatility creates both opportunities and challenges, this approach can significantly reduce your tax liabilities.\nCrypto tax-loss harvesting revolves around offsetting gains with losses. Short-term capital gains, taxed at higher rates, are offset first by short-term losses, while long-term losses apply to long-term gains. If losses exceed gains, the IRS permits up to $3,000 to offset ordinary income, with remaining losses carried forward to future years. This ability to strategically apply losses enables investors to reduce tax burdens over multiple years, optimizing financial outcomes while aligning with long-term investment objectives.\nSuppose you purchased 1 Bitcoin (BTC) for $60,000. Its current value is $50,000. Selling the BTC realizes a $10,000 loss, which can be used to offset gains from selling another asset, like Ethereum. This reduces the taxable income for the year.\nTax-loss harvesting for crypto requires understanding taxable events. Cryptocurrency transactions that trigger taxes include selling digital assets for fiat currency, trading one cryptocurrency for another (e.g., BTC to ETH), and using crypto to purchase goods or services. Even receiving cryptocurrency from mining or forks is considered taxable. However, buying crypto with fiat, gifting it, donating to a tax-exempt organization, or transferring assets between personal wallets are generally non-taxable. Recognizing these distinctions helps investors effectively plan and execute tax-loss harvesting strategies, ensuring compliance while minimizing taxable income.\nNot all cryptocurrency transactions are taxable, and these exemptions play a critical role in tax planning. For instance, transferring crypto between wallets you own is not a taxable event, making it irrelevant for tax-loss harvesting. Similarly, gifting crypto or donating to a qualified tax-exempt organization avoids triggering taxes, potentially lowering overall tax burdens. These exempt actions are important for investors looking to manage portfolios strategically while staying compliant with IRS rules, particularly during volatile market periods that encourage asset reallocation.\nUnderstanding cost basis is essential for optimizing tax-loss harvesting in cryptocurrency. The choice of cost-basis methods—HIFO, LIFO, and FIFO—significantly impacts tax-loss harvesting. HIFO (Highest In, First Out) is ideal for maximizing losses by selling the highest-cost assets first, optimizing tax savings. LIFO (Last In, First Out) targets the most recent acquisitions, useful for reducing short-term gains taxed at higher rates. FIFO (First In, First Out) sells the oldest assets first, often minimizing realized losses in rising markets but aligning with long-term strategies. While HIFO is best for loss optimization, FIFO offers simplicity. Selecting the right method depends on market conditions, goals, and accurate record-keeping, often aided by tax software or professionals.\nWhile non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as an exciting part of the crypto ecosystem, they carry unique tax implications. Like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are classified as property, making them eligible for tax-loss harvesting.\nTax-loss harvesting offers benefits but requires careful planning to maximize returns. Here are some crucial considerations:\nRealized losses can only offset capital gains in the same tax year. If losses exceed gains, up to $3,000 can be deducted against ordinary income, with excess losses carried forward to future years.\nConsider long-term objectives before selling assets. Align your strategy with your financial goals to avoid eroding potential long-term gains for short-term tax savings.\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are not currently subject to wash sale rules, pending legislation could change this. Stay updated on regulatory developments.\nBe mindful of transaction fees, which can diminish the tax savings from realized losses. Choose low-fee exchanges or platforms to maximize net gains.\nThe IRS has introduced new rules affecting cryptocurrency taxation, emphasizing the need for updated compliance strategies. Notably, like-kind exchanges are not permitted, meaning crypto-to-crypto trades are fully taxable events. Additionally, NFTs representing collectibles are taxed at higher long-term capital gains rates. Recent rulings also clarify tax implications for staking rewards, hard forks, and airdrops, ensuring they are reported as income. Staying informed about these updates allows investors to adapt their tax-loss harvesting strategies to align with the latest regulations.\nTax-loss harvesting is an essential strategy for crypto investors to reduce crypto tax liabilities and to enhance your crypto portfolio efficiency. With proper execution and the right tools, you can transform market volatility into a financial advantage. However, due to the rapidly evolving nature of crypto tax laws, consulting a tax professional is crucial.\nBy embracing tax-loss harvesting, you can optimize your investments while remaining compliant in an increasingly complex regulatory environment.","For years, bitcoin won by being boring.\nInvestors weren’t able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world’s largest cryptocurrency was valuable.\nIt was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn’t get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin’s core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That’s why many of crypto’s more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications.\nThe approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn’t really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo.\nBut times are changing for the original coin.\nDevelopers are increasingly building on bitcoin’s base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets.\nIn January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2.\nCreating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they’re investing.\nCollectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year.\nNearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September.\nVetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools.\nLunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares’ BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs.\nGalaxy Digital’s trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock’s bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust.\nOptions on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands.\nGalaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump’s administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5.\n“This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF’s long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead,” Galaxy’s trading team told CNBC.\nUntil now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading.\nOn Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches.\n“There’s a ton of leverage in the system right now,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday.\n“You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they’ve been, the basis is high,” Novogratz said. “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.”\nBitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000.\nMacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech."]}

This approach has become popular among both experienced traders and newcomers seeking steady and relatively low-risk profits.\nIn this guide, we’ll delve into how crypto arbitrage operates, the reasons behind its existence, its advantages and drawbacks, as well as the tools and strategies that can aid you in thriving in this ever-evolving market.\nCrypto arbitrage trading involves purchasing a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower and then selling it on another exchange where the price is higher. This price difference, known as the spread, presents traders with a chance to earn a profit.\nTo illustrate, consider it like buying a product at a discount store and then selling it at a higher price in a luxury store. The profit comes from the difference between the buying and selling prices, after accounting for any related costs.\nUnlike traditional stock markets, which are governed by strict regulations and operate during set hours, cryptocurrency markets are decentralized and available 24\/7. This continuous trading leads to price discrepancies across various exchanges due to several factors. They include:\nSome exchanges experience higher trading volumes, which can result in more favorable pricing, while smaller exchanges might show less competitive rates.\nVariations in demand based on region can affect prices, particularly on exchanges that serve specific markets.\nThe way exchanges collect and present data can also lead to differences in pricing.\nThese elements work together to create a landscape where price spreads are common, providing ongoing opportunities for arbitrage.\nAt its essence, crypto arbitrage consists of three straightforward steps:\nUtilize tools or conduct manual analysis to spot cryptocurrencies that have varying prices across different exchanges.\nBuy the cryptocurrency on the exchange with the lower price and sell it on the one with the higher price.\nMake sure that trading fees, withdrawal charges, and transfer times do not eat into your profits.\nFor instance:\nIf Bitcoin is priced at $20,000 on Exchange A and $20,050 on Exchange B, you can buy Bitcoin on Exchange A and sell it on Exchange B, earning a profit of $50 per Bitcoin, after deducting fees.\nWhat is important to note is that speed is crucial in this process, as price differences can vanish in seconds due to market fluctuations.\nCrypto arbitrage presents several benefits, making it an attractive strategy for traders. Some of these benefits include:\nUnlike speculative trading, arbitrage is based on predictable price spreads rather than uncertain market movements.\nArbitrage opportunities are available whether the market is bullish or bearish, as they focus on price gaps instead of overall trends.\nWith thousands of cryptocurrencies and numerous exchanges, traders can consistently find spreads to take advantage of.\nAlthough arbitrage is generally viewed as a low-risk strategy, it does come with its own set of challenges:\nRapid price fluctuations can diminish profits before trades are finalized.\nCosts such as transaction fees, withdrawal charges, and exchange fees can accumulate, affecting overall profitability.\nTrading on unregulated or unreliable platforms heightens the risk of losing funds. It's crucial to use reputable exchanges.\nEffective planning and risk management are vital to address these challenges.\nTraders utilize various strategies to enhance their profits from arbitrage opportunities. The most prevalent methods include:\n1. Simple Arbitrage\nPurchase cryptocurrency on one exchange and sell it on another where the price is higher.\nExample: If Ethereum is priced at $1,500 on Exchange A and $1,520 on Exchange B, buying on A and selling on B results in a $20 profit (after deducting fees).\n2. Triangular Arbitrage\nTake advantage of price discrepancies within a single exchange by trading across three different pairs.\nExample: Exchange Bitcoin (BTC) for Solana (SOL), then SOL for Dogecoin (DOGE), and finally DOGE back to BTC.\n3. Cross-Border Arbitrage\nCapitalize on regional price differences across international exchanges, often driven by local demand or regulatory factors.\nExample: Bitcoin may be priced lower on a U.S. exchange but could sell for a higher price on an Asian platform.\nTo effectively engage in arbitrage trading, it's crucial to use specialized tools that can simplify the process:\nThese automate trades by constantly monitoring prices across various exchanges and executing transactions in real-time.\nPlatforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko provide a detailed overview of cryptocurrency prices from multiple exchanges.\nThese tools notify you about profitable price differences, saving you both time and effort.\nThey enable you to examine transaction data and liquidity, offering valuable insights into market conditions.\nThese tools facilitate the arbitrage process, allowing traders to focus on strategy rather than manual tracking.\nCrypto arbitrage trading is an innovative strategy that capitalizes on price differences to create profit opportunities. By understanding the basics, utilizing the right tools, and implementing effective strategies, traders can maximize these spreads while minimizing risk.\nWhether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the cryptocurrency world, arbitrage offers a practical way to navigate the dynamic landscape of crypto trading. Start with small investments, keep yourself informed, and let the data guide your decisions.\nIdentify the gaps, seize the opportunities, and let the market work in your favor!\nCoinmonks is a non-profit Crypto Educational Publication.

As the market hovered close to this critical threshold, over $3.4 Billion in long leveraged bets were at risk of liquidation.\nMarket dynamics suggested that major players, often referred to as “whales,” could capitalize on this situation to push prices down to $95K, triggering these liquidations.\nThis tactic, known for flushing out over-leveraged positions, could pave the way for Bitcoin to rebound and aim for the $100K mark.\nSource: Coinglass\nTraders to stay vigilant, as the anticipated drop is not guaranteed but remains highly probable given the current market setup.\nFurther supporting this possible drop was the Binance’s aggressive short-selling on the Bitcoin market, suggesting a potential decline to $95K to scoop up liquidity before a bullish rebound to $100K.\nWith recent data revealing significant taker selling, market sentiment leans towards a strategic pullback.\nThis move, heavily influenced by large traders, may be a tactical play to shake out over-leveraged long positions.\nAs market dynamics hint at a manipulation tactic, traders should stay cautious of potential volatility spikes.\nSource: CryptoQuant\nThe observed trading patterns indicated that large players could be positioning for a substantial price movement, emphasizing the need for vigilance in the current unpredictable market environment.\nFirstly, Bitcoin’s journey towards the $100K mark showed a mix of volatility and anticipation. Trading on the CME revealed Bitcoin flirting with $99.8K, hinting at the imminent breach of the $100K barrier.\nThis proximity to the milestone in a major futures market suggested that BTC could soon see similar levels across various exchanges. Despite this, a retreat to $97K signaled potential fluctuations ahead.\nWith the CME’s pricing consistently on the higher side, the close at $99.8K underscores a bullish sentiment, yet traders should brace for possible sharp corrections or further climbs beyond $100K.\nSource: Trading View\nAgain, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings premium has returned to the highs of the 2021 bull run, reflecting the earlier market optimism.\nUnlike GBTC, which saw a -48% discount in the downturn, MicroStrategy’s premium consistently stayed positive.\nThis indicated Michael Saylor’s effective risk management in volatile times, further supporting that BTC’s strength was still in.\nSource: CryptoQuant\nRead Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025\nAs the market again shows signs of vitality, Saylor’s approach to maintaining stability despite the 2022 bear market pressures indicated his significant influence and foresight in the cryptocurrency domain.\nThis resilience suggested a strategic positioning that could favor long-term investors looking to leverage Bitcoin’s market cycles. The market remains on edge, illustrating the typical dynamism of crypto trading.","Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class, and over the years, they have continued to be the subject of scrutiny and criticism. Despite the success they’ve recorded over the years, many still believe that digital assets and tokens are entirely unreliable and that everyone who invests in them is willingly subjecting themselves to a scam of serious proportion.\nWhile there’s no denying the fact that cryptocurrencies are associated with elevated volatility and fluctuations, the latest Bitcoin price chart figures indicate that the number of investors willing to add capital to a crypto venture and include digital assets among their list of holdings continues to rise.\nThere are many reasons for this development, with the general economy continuing to be somewhat weak and uncertain being one of the primary ones. When standard marketplaces are not doing very well, people tend to gravitate towards asset classes that they may not even have considered in the past as a result of them being too risky or volatile.\nBut is this not an indicator of the fact that desperate people resort to desperate measures instead of a testament to the reliability and usability of cryptocurrencies? Are crypto coins still a valid form of investment, and is Bitcoin still a potential wealth creator? Or is it time for investors to set their sights elsewhere?\nBitcoin has been going through a rollercoaster ride over the last couple of years. 2020 was a halving year, and most community members expected things to unfold positively. Luckily, their predictions turned out to be true when the marketplace skyrocketed to new levels only a few months later.\n2021 was a significant time for Bitcoin users as the price reached $69,000, an incredible level that led many to consider BTC as a reliable investment option on par with traditional assets and holdings. However, this didn’t last long, and in fact, this period can be regarded as the calm before the storm in retrospect.\nThat’s because, in 2022, Bitcoin lost a considerable part of its value, with losses of around 70% during the most intense part of the bear market. The environment plunged into a crypto winter, one that was named the most severe in the entire history of cryptocurrencies by some analysts.\nWhile others pointed out that technical analysis indicates other events of this kind that took place in the past lasted longer, what set the one in 2022 apart was the fact that BTC had reached such a high level only one year earlier. To see all that melt away so quickly was tough for investors from all over the world, many of whom lost significant portions of their capital.\nSome of them decided to abandon crypto altogether out of fear that they’ll have to deal with even bigger losses in the future. Bitcoin reached a new bottom in 2022, settling at $16,000. For this reason, investors eagerly waited for the start of the new year, which was predicted to help the price bounce back.\nJanuary offered an opportunity for this, and BTC climbed to $20,000. By April, it touched the resistance area at $30,000, a level that hadn’t been reached since June 2022, right before prices had started dropping severely.\nWhile Bitcoin achieved a lot during 2023, investors continued to hope for better. 2024 kickstarted the beginning of a new era for BTC, as the approval of the exchange-traded funds caused a spike that took the price to a new all-time high, a little over $70K. The gains didn’t last long though, and were followed by considerable corrections.\nAs of November, the Bitcoin price has been showing stronger performance levels than ever before and managed to surpass all of its previous records. On November 18th, the BTC price was around $89,500, leading investors to believe that a six-figure value would become reality much sooner than expected.\nSince the crypto market is entirely decentralized, how the prices change and evolve is the result of a large number of factors. Volume, the general economic situation, and market sentiment are among the most essential aspects, and investors are careful to check these metrics before making important decisions.\nSome researchers have attributed Bitcoin’s current weak performance to whales and their activities, as this investor demographic finished a long phase of accumulation and has, therefore, reduced their positions. An address linked to one “Mr. 100” reached a peak of more than 73,000 BTC after accumulating over nearly a week. Paired with the exchange-traded funds’ outflows, analysts believe that this investor created turmoil within the community.\nThe derivatives and stablecoin flows have generally shown signals of decreased confidence levels among traders. Options data confirms an increase in temporary demands for downside protections as investors want to secure their portfolios. In the past, times of negative funding rates were typically short-lived, indicating that the bears don’t believe it is safe to start selling anywhere below the $60,000 mark.\nOctober has traditionally been recognised as a positive time for cryptocurrencies, a month during which digital assets perform well and investors see significant gains. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of the fact that September has the opposite reputation of being a time when the crypto market is doing quite poorly.\nHowever, this year, some traders have said that it would be a mistake to overinflate the importance of the entire month. This is because, under closer scrutiny, it is revealed that only the later part of October is recording bullish tendencies, not the first weeks. Data shows that Uptober tends to start around the 19th at the earliest, so it is vital for investors to remain patient and avoid making any impulsive decisions.\nThe statistics show that this is actually true for 2024 and that the marketplace is currently navigating the slowest October in the last decade. The prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum have declined since the beginning of the month, but the second half of October is more likely to make room for more robust growth. The last week of October may kickstart the beginning of the bullish cycle that continues until the end of the year, and then Bitcoin prices will be taken into the six-figure area that most investors expect.\nBitcoin is the most important cryptocurrency in the world, with the highest market capitalisation level. Investors have started trusting its abilities and believing in its value in increasing numbers, so although the market has been dealing with some challenges, it remains robust. In order to be successful in your trading ventures, though, you must still be ready to create a comprehensive strategy that is personalised to suit your goals and takes the long-term picture into account."]}

Now the question is, will bitcoin (BTC) continue its uptrend, and at what point can a sharp reversal happen?\nIf we take a look at former BTC market cycles, which happen every four years, then we see that we are now just starting to go into new bitcoin price discovery areas, and BTC could top out at new all-time highs, which is practically anything greater than the current resistance of $92,000. Bitcoin could even potentially see highs of $140,000+ based on prior supply and demand — i.e. halving cycles. On the contrary, what makes this market cycle a bit different than others is the vanished principle of BTC being an inflation hedge or digital gold. In theory, it was supposed to be — that is, at least, likely what Satoshi intended since bitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis. From what we saw in the last cryptocurrency bear market cycle, BTC is not an actual inflation hedge and performs like all other risk-on assets, so sentiment could change once the inauguration happens in January.\nAs we've seen before, politics could potentially just be politics until we see actual regulatory rollouts and a more favorable U.S. stance on paper with policies and laws that the markets fully embrace. Things seem to be going in the right direction with the news of Gensler resigning come January 20, 2025. The question remains on who will be his replacement; the wrong person and the smallest sentiment change in the wrong direction could fully accelerate a drawdown in BTC. We've previously seen what every Fed meeting minute has done to the price action of crypto which has, up until recently, always been negatively perceived. In other words, we are not fully out of the woods just yet, especially until there is clarity on who could be Gensler’s replacement.\nThe BTC ETFs played a vital role this year in institutionalizing the cryptocurrency, which allowed for RIA and fiduciary investment in bitcoin, although in a turnaround market the same volumes that helped bitcoin get to the point it is at today can be the same volumes and outflows that present a downfall. This can lead to crippling sentiment as we all know the crypto bull market does not last forever and drawdowns of 70-80% can be expected.\nLooking at prior BTC bull market cycles, BTC has seen drawdowns of 20-30%. Can the same be expected with all the new factors under the current and new market structure? Analysts assume less drawdown and volatility scenarios due to the BTC ETF options offered by iShares and others, although on the contrary, systematic strategies still seem to be sought after with investors taking bets on market volatility, which only recently (in 2022) saw an equity market-like expansion in the crypto markets where enough volume, market cap, and stability existed for the shorting functionality of some coins.\nWith more market participants and more avenues of shorting functionality across all crypto assets, including BTC, this can create more volatility in the short-term. Compared to the last market cycle, there are a lot more traditional finance (TradFi) players trading and market making in the space now, which in a way is offset by more institutional capital locked up (mostly in ETFs since the venture space in crypto dried up from the fast money of the last bull market). Although in a way, no matter how much institutional capital enters the space, the market cycle of BTC will follow volatility— it's just in its decentralized nature.\nRegardless of whatever outlook one has on the price of BTC, it's important to realize that this is a different market than before. Gone are the days of quick “hot money” returns with the inevitable crypto risk factors ever present. One must remain cautious, but optimistic, on where things are going, if not bullish on the market cycle and structure alone. Regardless, for every type of investor, there is a huge opportunity due to the immense growth of the industry, and when that window will close is anyone's guess — the only thing for certain is that the new market cycle is just getting started.\nSemir Gabeljic is a director of capital formation and investment strategy at Pythagoras Investments, a leading absolute return crypto quant hedge fund formed in 2014. Prior to that, Semir holds experience at Pantera Capital assisting with capital formation and Goldman Sachs as an investor in their private equity\/private credit group.","The bitcoin (BTC) bull market has further to run, and the world's largest cryptocurrency is expected to punch through the $100,000 level in the near term, Galaxy Research said in a note on Tuesday.\nGalaxy said bitcoin will continue to rise for several reasons.\nIncreasing institutional and corporate adoption, the potential for the creation of bitcoin nation-state reserves, and a new pro-crypto U.S. administration all point to a move higher in the near and medium term, the report said.\nIt may not be all plain sailing, as \"there could even be some twilight regulatory or law enforcement actions from the outgoing Biden administration that jitter markets,\" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy.\nStill, the bitcoin setup over the next two years \"appears unique and bullish,\" the analyst wrote.\nThe options market positioning is also bullish, the report noted.\nThe launch of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) options could result in greater liquidity and potentially lower volatility, Galaxy said.

With this dramatic price movement, crypto stocks are also thrust into the spotlight.\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR), a major online trading platform, has observed this shift, noting increased interest in stocks tied to the cryptocurrency market.\nAs Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, investors are turning their attention to companies involved in the crypto space. Crypto stocks are now seen as an attractive investment, offering exposure to the digital asset market without directly holding cryptocurrency.\nAccording to IBKR, there has been a notable surge in the trading volume of stocks linked to crypto-related companies, including mining firms, blockchain technology firms, and crypto exchanges.\n“We’re seeing a significant uptick in crypto-related stock trading,” said Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers. “As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, more investors are diversifying their portfolios into crypto stocks as an indirect way to gain exposure to the digital asset boom.”\nBitcoin’s hunt for the $100,000 price point has drawn global attention. The digital currency’s recent surge is fueled by strong institutional interest and favorable market conditions. While Bitcoin’s rise could attract new investors, it is also causing ripples throughout the broader financial market.\nBitcoin’s rally is encouraging more capital to flow into such stocks, making these companies more appealing to investors looking to benefit from the growing digital asset ecosystem. The high volatility and massive potential returns associated with such stocks are especially attractive to retail investors.\n“Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark would likely create a major shift in the investment landscape, benefiting companies with strong exposure to crypto,” said Sosnick. “This kind of price movement reinforces the growing legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into traditional finance.”\nThe rise of crypto stocks could significantly reshape the crypto industry. As more investors seek to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets, crypto-related stocks may see a prolonged period of growth. This influx of investment could further legitimize the industry, leading to greater innovation and development of blockchain technology.\nHowever, there are concerns regarding the volatility that crypto stocks may bring to the market. While crypto stocks provide a way to gain exposure to digital assets, their value is often heavily correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. If Bitcoin faces sudden drops or corrections, these stocks could also experience sharp declines.\nAs Bitcoin pushes toward $100,000, the rise in crypto stock trading reflects the growing interest in the digital asset space. However, this market shift also brings challenges.\nFor investors, understanding the risks and volatility associated with crypto stocks will be essential for making informed decisions. While the bullish outlook for Bitcoin could propel crypto stocks to new heights, the industry must remain vigilant about the potential risks that come with such rapid growth.","Sign in\nSign in\nGoat News\nFollow\n--\nThe expiration of $13.6 billion in Bitcoin options this Friday has everyone wondering if this might be the trigger needed to launch BTC’s price towards the coveted $100,000 mark.\nOptions in the crypto market are akin to options in traditional finance. They allow traders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price before a certain date. This financial instrument provides leverage, meaning traders can control larger amounts of Bitcoin with less capital, potentially leading to significant price shifts when large volumes expire. The expiry of these options can cause fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price as traders adjust their positions. If the market sentiment remains bullish, it might fuel a buying spree, pushing prices higher. Conversely, bearish sentiment could lead to selling pressure.\nCurrent market sentiment is mixed, with some investors bullish about Bitcoin’s prospects due to macroeconomic factors, technological advancements, and increasing institutional adoption. Others remain cautious, citing regulatory fears and market volatility as potential hurdles.\nmedium.com\nmedium.com\nmedium.com\nAnalyzing previous Bitcoin options expiries can provide insight. Significant expiries in the past have led to heightened volatility, as seen in December 2020, when Bitcoin prices swung dramatically following options expirations. This historical data suggests that large expiries can indeed act as catalysts for major price movements.\nSeveral factors could impact whether Bitcoin reaches the $100K milestone:\nThe Bitcoin community plays a crucial role in shaping market sentiment.

With record-high staking participation, growing Layer 2 adoption, and a major upgrade on the horizon, Ethereum is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the blockchain ecosystem.\nNovember 2024 marked a defining moment for Solana (SOL), as it solidified its position as a leading altcoin through groundbreaking performance and ecosystem growth. With its price reaching an all-time high of $264, significant institutional interest, and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency landscape.\nSource: DefiLlama\nSolana’s breakout performance in November 2024 underscores its potential as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. With record highs in price, trading volume, and ecosystem adoption, Solana is poised to redefine its role in the blockchain space. For market participants, aligning with its growth trajectory could yield substantial rewards in the months to come.\nDonald Trump’s re-election in 2024 has ushered in a pro-crypto agenda aimed at fostering innovation and regulatory clarity. This shift has bolstered the cryptocurrency market, driving institutional participation and expanding the scope of digital asset investment vehicles. A key development has been the wave of spot Bitcoin and Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting the growing interest in regulated crypto products.\nThe Trump administration’s pro-crypto governance is shaping the U.S. cryptocurrency market by fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and expanding investment opportunities. The influx of ETF filings, including those for Solana and Bitcoin, highlights the evolving landscape. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, the U.S. is poised to solidify its position as a global leader in digital assets.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. In November 2024, AI-focused tokens surged in popularity, driven by partnerships, real-world applications, and increasing institutional interest. These tokens are bridging the gap between blockchain technology and AI, positioning themselves as key players in the Web3 landscape.\nRisk management:\nAI tokens are reshaping the Web3 narrative by bringing real-world utility to blockchain technology. As adoption grows across industries, these tokens have the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems interact with AI. For traders and investors, the focus should remain on projects with strong partnerships, innovative applications, and a clear regulatory roadmap.\nBlockchain gaming continues to solidify its role in the Web3 ecosystem, addressing criticisms of prioritizing profits over playability. November 2024 witnessed notable advancements as projects focused on enhancing gameplay experiences, while adoption metrics highlighted the sector’s resilience. This section explores key trends, case studies, and market performance within the blockchain gaming landscape.\nBlockchain gaming is undergoing a transformative phase, balancing profitability with meaningful player experiences. As projects innovate to address accessibility and retention, the sector’s potential to drive Web3 adoption becomes increasingly apparent. For market participants, staying aligned with evolving player preferences and technological advancements will be crucial.\nBlockchain is pushing the boundaries of what Play-to-Earn (P2E) models can achieve. In November 2024, AMBCrypto conducted an exclusive survey involving over 5,000 participants, shedding light on key challenges and opportunities in this growing sector. The findings reveal a shift in player priorities, with an increasing emphasis on playability and sustainable ecosystems.\nThe NFT market in November 2024 continued its transformation from a speculation-driven space to one emphasizing real-world utility and innovation. While trading volumes declined by 15% MoM, projects focusing on functional NFTs gained traction, highlighting a shift in market priorities.\nSource: NFTGo\nThe NFT market in November 2024 reflects a critical pivot toward sustainability and utility.

Dropped in your hands is a big bag of cowries by your old master whom you’ve trained under for years—a gift—to ease the journey to stand on your own.\n“They’re just empty shells”, he says to you, in your sing-song mother tongue. “But you decide the weight each one carries, we all do.” Ah, dreamy.\nUnfortunately, it’s 2024. And each government says all the money is theirs—the biggest mistake in our history.\nIf you struck gold while digging in your compound, who owns it? How about in the forest?\nYou see, Satoshi was fed up with this control that governments demand and, saw the digital economy as the weight to counterbalance it. They “back” their fiat currencies mainly because they make & enforce the rules. It’s their world, and we should consider ourselves lucky to be in it, they think.\nBut through the bold attempt known today as Bitcoin, our world slips through their grasp.\nAs Satoshi expected, volatility is\/was inevitable as adoption grows. BTC was created to serve as an alternative store of value beyond centralized regulation, but it will remain unstable until global adoption is reached.\nThis is not the first conversation about a global currency. The fate of money was changed forever at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, which replaced the GBP with the USD as our monetary reserve. (GBP had silently replaced Isaac Newton’s local-turned-global gold standard through its colonial influence)\nThis was a global decision made by representatives from 44 (out of 195) countries at this conference held in the USA. How did we get here?\nJohn Maynard Keynes (English Academic Economist) had been pushing for a global currency for years. His voice was finally relevant during WWII when Europe realized the difficulties of global trade with their [former] colonies and other countries for essentials & weapons.\nSince America had been instrumental in the war and had grown in global influence, Harry Dexter White (American Government Economist) pushed for the dollar standard with Keynes. And the room agreed, believing the dollar would stay pegged to gold.\nTracing the sequence of events that led us to this point is not the purpose of this piece, but this was the final thread in our entanglement. And in 1971, US President Richard Nixon crushed the Bretton Woods system by annulling the USD peg to gold at $35 per ounce.\nThe “Nixon shock” rug-pulled the whole world. Sounds familiar?\nIn Satoshi’s design, temporary volatility was the tradeoff for long-term stability & trust.\nWeb3 was built by stacking two technologies: the blockchain and cryptocurrency, each serving the other to provide the security & decentralization builders strive for to this day.\nBy explaining how they both work, Satoshi made them open-source, expecting others to carry the technology further than the initial design by standing on its stacked shoulders.\nThe largest barrier to entry for Bitcoin is not necessarily awareness or technology. It’s the confidence that the value I store as crypto is not Schrödinger's cat. Fiat has provided less volatility in this sense, but none near zero without negative consequences.\nAnd while there are “stable”-coins pegged to fiat currencies, they go down with them too. Old money was not based on abstractions or a flimsy trust in the government. If we were not sure the sun would shine tomorrow, we could not live.\nWith careful execution, a stable, decentralized, non-fiat-pegged cryptocurrency is possible.\nAnd if its primary function is near-zero volatility, what would happen to the world if we built it on the Bitcoin blockchain, right here?\nSeat belt, we’re changing gears.\nResources are the most valuable things on this planet. Money exists to trade resources—a resource-rich country can create infinite possibilities with its natural gifts.\nAnd when resources are scarce, your money is worthless. Empty shells, just like your master promised. Money is merely a representation of the inherent & time-bound value of resources. Pegging money to money alone is the most stupid thing I ever heard, but we’ll get back to this.\nCountries infiltrate other countries to seize or swindle their resources: labour, gold, oil, diamonds, pleasure—name it. Nothing of value is off-limits to power-drunk people, only the strong can protect their treasures.\nSince it’s clear that the real value is in resources, we dare not peg our near-zero volatility stablecoin to the USD.\nThis coin must be commodity-backed.\nThe gold standard was triggered by Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint. His job was to keep the coins in circulation at the specified weight & quality.\nBy standardizing the gold coins—Britain’s sovereign commodity, Newton brought a modular system to the British economy because of the nature of gold. It’s everywhere, divisible and acceptable even if not minted.\nBritain’s standard gold coin was the guinea: each containing (in today’s units) 8.3 grams of 22-carat gold, equivalent to 1.05 pounds sterling.\nThis British pound was abstract, merely representing & quantifying all the different qualities of gold they traded. Think of it like a unit. Units help us convert properties by highlighting their relationships.\nSo if you brought new gold into circulation, Newton’s team standardized it. They did the same to foreign and old gold coins in circulation too, so the British people could trust the money—without having to trust each other or the government.\nThe GBP standardized transactions in real-time, while Newton worked to standardize the coins in circulation to ease trade. Coins in circulation became the same weight, purity & design, reducing the need for verification.\nThe highest asset quality of any commodity-based monetary standard is one that is easily verified.\nOur commodity’s value must be easily verified, with a clear potential for future exchange. Low risk.\nThe two crucial factors that make a stablecoin are Liquidity & Collateral. If everything in existence is energy in motion, then:\nLiquidity is kinetic energy: The measure of value available for instant trade.\nCollateral is potential energy: The measure of value available for future trade.\nWe just discussed collateral. But when you give someone money as payment, you get the resources—the real value, and they hold only the money. This is a risk because there’s always the potential to lose value by holding the money.\nIf you held $1 for 25 years, it most likely will not get you the same things it could before, for example.\nBecause of this risk of losing value by saving money, currencies are backed up by tangible collateral (resources) to give users the confidence that Schrödinger hasn’t set them up. *coughs in Nixon*\nThis exchange pegs the value of the collateral to A value of the currency. But if the “measure of value available for instant trade“ aka Liquidity drops, so will the value of the coin.\nBut if liquidity stays high, people will be too busy exchanging resources to worry about risk, even though it’s always there.\nLiquidity is how easy it is to get your money out of a system when you need it.\nAssuming there are enough resources to back up our abstract money (there usually aren’t), this ease depends on how willing the market is to swap with you for those resources.\nFundamentally, every unit of currency you have represents physical resources.\nOur stablecoin must be light & essential: built on commodities people can’t do without, and be easy to manage.\nAfter several rug-pulls and devaluations of various cryptocurrencies, the next stage of web3 is pretty clear.\nWe want our coin to fill this vacuum successfully. For it to be a stable, decentralized, non-fiat-pegged cryptocurrency, we’ve looked at our past monetary failures and successes.\nWe know it has to be pegged to a commodity that is essential, light, and easy to verify. Can you think of any ideas?\nFor the sake of this piece, I’ll bring up a bizarre example so it’ll stick better. Nuclear warheads will be our Commodity. Haha, stay with me.\nThe record from early this year is about 12,121 units in existence. They never tell us the real number. Our smart contract will be based on the condition that the number of warheads deployed will always = 0.\nWe don’t want them used anywhere again. Essential.\nWhile it’s an opportunity for a demonstration of blockchain technology to maintain “world peace”, the likelihood of all governments agreeing to share the real-time data is slim. They want the advantage of surprise. Not Light.\nFor our code, should we just assume it was light and we had that data published on a blockchain?\nWe’d then include an oracle in our smart contract because it’s a real-world scenario that affects us directly.\nMarket confidence in this coin would be low because government participation is unlikely, so we can’t test the blockchain. And if the data was available, would you really want to know if it was headed your way?\nSo let’s try again.\nThis time, we’ll focus on triggering our smart contract when there’s a nuclear launch attempt instead of our imminent doom.\nCombining satellite imaging and the work of organizations that track nuclear weapons & publish their data, we can create comprehensive data to work with. We’ll turn this data into one or two simple, useful metrics to feed our blockchain, achieving public accessibility without compromising security.\nFirst, we’ll go a step further and combine the satellite & open-source data with real-world events using AI to create our first metric: the Fear Index.\nIt would be a part of the smart contract but not a consequential factor in calculating the main condition—a nuclear launch attempt. It would serve as a pulse check for leaders, but more importantly, it would give people something to gnaw on.\nThis is important for preventing the coin from becoming volatile due to panic. Instead of telling us to calm down, we’ll quantify our fears.\nFear is contagious, so we’ll quarantine it. But this index is not enough on its own.\nBeside it, will be the Calm Index, a metric based on satellite imaging & field data alone to say, we haven’t recorded any attempts using our best sources. Ideally, this Calm Index will remain stagnant if there are no attempts to activate or launch one, keeping the coin stable when much worse happens to fiat during wars.\nOur coin’s value will remain fixed to the number of warheads remaining vs the number of warheads fired. Not the attempts.\nThis means we’d have to fire all of them to make the coin volatile.\nNow, let’s see our blockchain.\nWhen I started working on this, I asked all my web3 nerd friends if they could build a stablecoin on the BTC blockchain assuming they had a reliable peg. The consensus?\nIt’s possible but difficult.\nIt seems Rootstock hasn’t become as popular as it should be yet. Though web3 tech evolves beyond Satoshi’s vision, the buck still stops at the coin made of bits, the Bitcoin.\nEach new phase of web3 takes us back to the drawing board. Its blockchain is an untapped resource and Rootstock is the taproot. Why build a stablecoin on any other chain?\nTo keep this article brief, I described our stablecoin project to the Perplexity AI. Then I asked for the metrics for a high-quality blockchain and the metrics the project needs.\nIt scored high for each of these, which you can plug into your AI to verify yourself:\nThen I asked it to tell me if Rootstock could do the job. The short answer is yes. It’s a very useful Bitcoin sidechain, including the possibility of liquidity options from DeFi apps when designing our infrastructure.\nCoin Name: KOINONIA\nTicker: KONKONB-LO\nBlockchain: Rootstock\/Bitcoin\nMinting Conditions: Unlimited, if for the past 365 days, the number of nuclear warhead fire ATTEMPTS daily \/ the number of warheads FIRED daily > 0.\nPeg Mechanism: Conditional value; the number of nuclear warheads FIRED daily = 0.\nInitial Supply: Number of warheads x 10^(Duration of 1st nuclear weapon agreement in years) = 12,121 x 10^25\nGas Fees: Let’s build the code.\nI wrote it in Solidity, including one for our hypothetical oracle. Next, we’ll compile it into bytecode using Hardhat.\nHere are our programs:\nAnd for the Oracle, which will get data from the same sources as our Fear & Calm Indexes.\nEstimated at around 200,000 - 300,000 gas units.\nAssuming a gas price of 30 gwei, this would cost approximately:\n250,000 gas × 30 gwei ≈ $15 USD\nEach call could cost approximately 50,000 - 100,000 gas units, leading to a cost of about:\n75,000 gas × 30 gwei ≈$ 4.50 USD\nI can hardly write code but with AI this was possible. I fed Perplexity this data in the flux and asked for cost optimisation & estimation.\nPersonally Haunting Questions\nConclusion\nTo allow for future updates, we would add a proxy contract like so:\nTo ensure that the contract works with the proxy, we’ll make a slight mod:\nThrough this proxy contract, we can update things. The number of nuclear warheads is more likely to increase over time. We can add new units for them, and make other necessary modifications (like adding in the Fear & Calm Indexes & conditional backing tweaks) without messing up our systems or causing inconveniences.\nThe condition for our Asset Quality was that it would be easy to verify. For Asset Liquidity, it was that it would be built on commodities people can’t do without, and be easy to manage.\nSince such activity is typically kept under wraps, we first benefit by increasing our involvement a little more in our family’s survival. If adopted, we tie all our fates together to create a raft that stays afloat, and a third leg that even fiat can lean on.\nNuclear weapons are very expensive. And if they aren’t used to wage war, they can be recycled to serve nuclear plants and projects. The risk of the collateral losing value is quite low. Instead of representing only pain, these are valuable earth minerals that we’ll always need, as is our human nature.\nThe more positive attention is directed to nuclear weapons in their potential state by turning them into cryptocurrency collateral, the harder it’ll be to deploy them. Their value will also increase beyond their destructive potential.\nThis is where web3 shines best, giving us the tools to change the energy states of the physical world in our consciousness.\nPerhaps such changes will reduce the need for the nuclear stalemate we use to keep the peace. The challenges towards achieving this are great, but a wise man once said,\n“Where the willingness is great, the difficulty cannot be great”\nRemember that this topic is just an example to guide your understanding of what it takes for us to achieve this stablecoin, and its ripple effects.\nBecause its value is condition-based, it wouldn’t depend on the US dollar, whose value comes from the trust in the government.\nIt couldn’t operate in a bubble but exist in its dimension while interacting with each currency natively.\nSo 1 Koinonia = 1 nuclear potential,\nwhich could be linked to [Amount of] energy output from [Radioactive Material] source for [Amount of] load conditions.\nThe local price of energy could then be used as the bureau de change, where you store some of your money as energy in the form of KONKONB-LO. Worth it, yeah?\nThe existence of this our sample “near-zero” stablecoin might shock initially as an existential threat to any anarchist, cybercriminal or government, but we introduce the energy discussion to calm them down.\nSome might dare to deploy the warheads to fluctuate the currency. After all, they could aim for a place where nobody lives, they might think.\nBut we can quickly identify the source with our tech and begin to take economic sanctions against those responsible. Because its value is based on what happens today, our coin could return to stability as soon as the next day, if it shakes.\nThere will also be fail safes to ensure people can get some money out, but not all of it. The only way to keep our coin volatile is to keep firing nuclear weapons daily, and that's no machine gun.\nFor this hypothetical coin to succeed, we’ll need to keep talking about it, poking holes in it, growing it and building our trust in it.\nWe’d need to expect some negative sentiment upfront and change people’s perspectives by doing good work.\nBut without international support, it can’t reach its full potential. I’ll finish this—but first; how do we test our code in a controlled environment?\nWe compile our contract to begin testing.\nThis means exporting it as a folder containing the Solidity source code (.sol file) and the compiled code JSON files of your bytecode (the binary version), ABI (Application Binary Interface) & other metadata.\nNext, deploying using deployment tools like Rootstock CLI, Hardhat, JavaScript libraries (like Web3.js), or wallets like MetaMask. Once we link the tool to the folder, we can create & broadcast our transaction on the blockchain.\nWe have the estimates for gas fees, and each tool used (above) comes with instructions to initiate the transaction. Once that’s complete, we’ll receive our contract address, live on the Rootstock TestNET Explorer.\nThis is possible because we created a network, an information circuit. We sent our code into the blockchain, it went through the loop and returned with an address. That’s how Apple shares information between devices but, here, their server manages your data instead of the blockchain.\nIt’s like creating a hotspot through your phone that your computer connects to. Then you create a hotspot from your computer and your phone connects to it as WiFi. Information is then sent on this network using our address.\nEach transaction sent to this address carries a packet of data carrying our instructions to the Rootstock sidechain. With it, we get all the benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain + advanced smart contracts like this.\nThis is our playground, and over time we see if our plan works before we move on to the mainnet.\nRootstock provided its Docs library & Developer courses for help.\nNot so bad, hey? Let’s talk about Quency-Quences.\nThis type of powerful stablecoin could even end up replacing governments completely if enough projects develop to fund practical solutions for involved communities instead of say, a mathematical solution like Satoshi designed in Bitcoin. But hold on, we like Math.\nOur coin is protected by Satoshi’s web of its complexities + the relevance of the problem it solves to the global community.\nWhile this sort of power costs significant autonomy from local and otherwise governments, it pays back with stability to reserve their fiat—if they’re wise enough to see the benefits. Societies that embrace technology govern better.\nIt’s quite similar to the GBP handing over the office of serving as the global fiscal reserve to Britain after it had exhausted its savings in “World” War. More like the Northern War if you ask me. Nobody asked our opinion on it, instead conscripted our labour AND economy.\nAfter much warcraft, Rome learned to keep trading with Africa regardless.\nDid you ever wonder why Nixon would kill the peg?\nUS wanted to expand its influence. Do you know where the world is today because of this drive?\nNow whoever is in that presidency bears the sole responsibility for the economic fate of the world.\n“Bet on us”, Nixon said.\nAnd through their position, America worked tirelessly to secure the resources of other governments.\nIn a sense, it’s patriotic. In another, war is patriotic;\nthey'll say they’re fighting to preserve their patrimony (freedom), even by taking the patrimony (resources) of others.\nYou having a stronger currency than theirs means they need you more, so they make excuses for their actions to hold on to power.\nRelinquishing some of this power to such a stablecoin would make their jobs (looting and\/or farming) much easier, while energy-rich African countries get another market to show their mettle, potentially causing unprecedented shifts in their cash flow.\nWould they willingly invest in a stablecoin pegged to weaker currencies in their position?\nTo save your currency, they’ll tell you to, “make better deals with us and trade more within your system.” For us at the mercy of their wars, these deals have wrecked us through their swindling and infiltration.\nOur trust in the US dollar is not earning. We lose precious resources to their economic practices for stressful power. In our neighborhood, China is packing out our lithium this time.\nOil & lithium are small resources in all the possibilities of energy. Why tie a knot once if it’s stronger twice?\nTo live is to rebel. Every day, we live in rebellion against death. Find satisfaction in your rebellion.\nLike those gladly risking their lives for glory, there’s a lot you’re equally capable of if you accept some risk.\nDo you see yourself holding such a coin?"]}
