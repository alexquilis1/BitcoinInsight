That’s the highest spread in at least a year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Historical volatility indicates the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period.\nThe bitcoin-ether volatility spread flipped positive weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing traders to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it.\nSince then, traders have been squarely focused on the activity in the spot ETFs, with net inflows breeding upside volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market. In the meantime, the dwindling probability of the SEC approving an ETH ETF by May seems to have demotivated ether traders.\nBitcoin blockchain’s upcoming reward halving, a quadrennial event that reduces the pace of per block BTC emission by 50%, could be another reason for relatively higher volatility in the cryptocurrency.\nOn April 21, the inbuilt code will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the miner’s revenue, which, as per ByteTree, is currently at $26 billion annually.\nThe consensus is that halving is bullish as it halves the pace of supply expansion, creating a demand-supply imbalance in favor of a price rise, assuming the demand side remains unchanged or strengthens. Bitcoin chalked out stellar rallies, setting new record highs over 12-18 months following the previous halvings, which occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020.\nWhat’s different this time is that bitcoin has surpassed the previous bull market peak of around $69,000 weeks ahead of the halving, which makes the upcoming event all the more exciting for traders.\nPer Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, the bullish positioning ahead of the halving means potential for a “sell-the-news\" pullback after the event.\n“The current positioning being so extended is setting the market up for a VERY interesting 'sell-the-news’ halving cycle play,” Magadini said in the weekly newsletter. “Should there be a real pullback, we stand to see excessive ∆1 [futures] OI become liquidated, volatility RR-skew to favor puts and a collapsing basis.”\nMagadini added that bitcoin’s options market has been pricing the halving event as well.\n“If we look at the options market, we see an interesting structure. A steep [IV] Contango before 4\/26 and a high forward volatility kink for the 4\/26 expiration. The options market is pricing in the halving event as well,” Magadini noted.\nThe implied volatility, or IV, is the market’s guess of future realized volatility. Usually, plotting IVs for different durations or expiries produces an upward-sloping curve called a contango.\nA steep contango ahead of the April 26 expiry means the market is expecting elevated BTC volatility as it heads into the halving. The forward volatility suggests the same.","HOUSTON, April  01, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc.

As we look to 2024, we are enthusiastic about the prospects for continued expansion, highlighted by the substantial growth of our ETPs and the introduction of innovative products and offerings. Our commitment is to enhance our market presence through strategic partnerships, geographic expansion, and diversification of our product lineup, aiming to maximize AUM.\"\nETPs\/Valour:\nValour's ETP business had AUM of $508 million as of December 30, 2023, a 476% increase from December 31, 2022's AUM of $106 million. Valour's current AUM stands at $880 million.\nLiquidity:\nThe Company ended Fiscal 2023 with a cash balance of $6.7 million, compared to $4.9 million at the end of Fiscal 2022.\nFinancial Performance:\nFor Fiscal 2023:\nOutlook for 2024:\nThe Company has experienced significant revenue growth since the end of 2023, continuing rapidly through the first quarter of 2024. Valour's  ETPs have witnessed an 800% increase in AUM from the market lows in late 2022, alongside growth in trading volumes. As of March 28, 2024, Valour's AUM stood at approximately C$880 million (US$650 million), with daily trading volumes exceeding C$20.3 million (US$15 million). Staking and lending income, as well as management fees, are closely correlated with Valour's product capital inflow and the price of digital assets underlying Valour's ETPs, which has grown substantially in the last few months. Revenue from arbitrage and liquidity provision is highly linked to overall market activity and turnover in Valour's listed ETPs. Given the current AUM, price of digital assets and activity level in the digital asset market, the Company's annualized top-line revenue is forecasted to be approximately C$63.3 Million (USD 46.8 million) for 20241. Growth in AUM is expected to lead to proportional increases in revenue. Since there is a strong correlation between the Company's revenues and the digital asset market's price levels and activity, revenue trajectories will fluctuate with market conditions, while costs remain stable, reflecting Valour's business' scalability.\nFurthermore, the continuous improvement in product mix is a crucial driver of monetization levels. The ETP business aims to maximize AUM through increased ETP launches and geographical expansion. The Company plans on launching approximately 15 ETP products in 2024 and an additional 30 in 2025 as the Company continues to take advantage of extremely positive macro fundamentals for the ecosystem in general.\n____________________________\n1This projection is based on the assumption that no new ETPs are introduced and that AUM remains constant at current levels throughout 2024. Should AUM increase, revenues are expected to rise accordingly; conversely, a decrease in AUM would lead to a reduction in revenues.\nFurther to the press release of the Company dated January 8, 2024 with respect to the Company's change of auditor from BF Borgers CPA PC (the \"Former Auditor\") to HDCPA Professional Corporation (the \"Successor Auditor\"), the Company also announces that it has filed its financial statements of the Company for fiscal-year 2023 with restated comparative information for fiscal 2022 and the corresponding management's discussion and analysis.\nThe Company became aware of an enforcement report issued by the Canadian Public Accountability Board (\"CPAB\") on December 7, 2023 against the Former Auditor (the \"Enforcement Report\") resulting from an engagement findings report dated October 12, 2023 (the \"CPAB Report\"). As a result of the Enforcement Report, the Successor Auditor provided a consultation with respect to the CPAB Report, remediation plan requested by CPAB and the impact on the scope of the audit for fiscal 2023 (the \"Consultation\")\nAs a result of the Consultation, the Company reassessed the application of IFRS on the accounting the valuation of the Company's holdings in 3iQ and AMINA Bank AG (formerly SEBA Bank AG) as well as the valuation of Valour's Genesis loan and collateral posted to secure such loan. Compared with the previously filed fiscal 2022 financial statement of the Company, the Amended and Restated Financial Statements reflected a (i) reduction in digital assets by $2,433,348 to $104,148,728 as at December 31, 2022; and (ii) reduction in private investments, at fair value through profit and loss, by $13,489,824 to $30,015,445 as at December 31, 2022, with an opening retained earnings impact at January 1, 2023 of $15,923,172.  For more details, please refer to Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements of the Company for years ended December 31, 2023 and the Amended and Restated Financial Statements.\n\"We are pleased to have completed the audit for Fiscal 2023 and the restatement of the Fiscal 2022 statement of the Company,\" said Ryan Ptolemy, Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nDeFi Technologies Inc.

Amid economic unpredictability and following closely behind it, searches for assets to protect purchasing power, Toobit has stepped forward as a provider for safe investment solutions in digital currencies, much like Bitcoin.\nEscalating Inflation Concerns\nWith inflation reaching unprecedented highs across many parts of the globe, both individuals and institutions alike are seeking out assets to safeguard their wealth from diminishing purchasing power. Traditional safe buys, such as gold, are getting with the times and now are joining up with digital assets like Bitcoin as potential store of value solutions.\nToobit's Visionary Approach\nToobit has conducted extensive research and analysis on market trends on  Bitcoin's role within the investment landscape. The platform is a strong advocate for the use of Bitcoin to mitigate against inflation's adverse effects, offering clients an innovative interface and tools to manage their investments efficiently.\nKey Benefits Outlined by Toobit for Bitcoin Investments:\nDecentralization: Bitcoin's decentralized nature provides it with greater protection from government policies and central bank interventions that typically cause inflation.Bitcoin's Limited Supply: At only 21 Million Bitcoins available to be created, its limited supply effectively combats inflation directly - offering an interesting contrast with fiat currencies which are created unrestrictedly.\nAccess and Liquidity: Bitcoin's global market operates 24\/7, giving investors unmatched liquidity and global investment access compared to traditional markets with set trading hours.Toobit's initiative has garnered the endorsement of various financial experts and economists who recognize its potential as an anti-inflationary measure. One of the Toobit experts, an economist, noted that Toobit's integration of Bitcoin into investor portfolios is \"an innovative solution that fits within today's economic climate\".\nToobit's commitment to financial education and security goes far beyond offering strategic investment services. Rather, Toobit prioritizes education on cryptocurrency investment for its clients while protecting investments with great mmeasures and even offering simplified investment processes for novice and veteran traders alike.\nFuture-Focused Investment\nToobit remains committed to being at the forefront of financial innovation, which means exploring additional cryptocurrencies and digital assets which could act as inflation hedges.\nQuestions People May also Ask:\nHow do I purchase Bitcoin?\nYou can buy Bitcoin in various places on the Internet. However, it's important to select a reliable and secure exchange that suits you. You can also buy Bitcoin on Toobit by following steps below:\nWhen Is Bitcoin Halving?\nBitcoin Halving is an event which occurs approximately every four years or every 210,000 blocks mined, as part of Satoshi Nakamoto's protocol and intended to control supply by limiting total circulation of 21 Million Coins; thus extending the lifetime of reward schemes while combatting inflation. Recent instances took place in May 2020 and Apr 2024 respectively, marking pivotal milestones for miners, investors and the cryptocurrency market at large.\nHow much is a Bitcoin Worth?\nThe value of one Bitcoin (BTC) can vary dramatically over time, often experiencing dramatic swings within just hours or days depending on factors like market demand, investor sentiment and global economic factors. Since 2022, it has seen prices range anywhere from around $15,000 in 2022 to more than $71,000 by 2024 - to get an accurate snapshot of current values it is essential to regularly visit cryptocurrency exchanges or financial news websites, where rates are constantly updated in real-time in response to dynamic markets.\nIs Bitcoin a good Investment?\nBitcoin can be an ideal investment option depending on an investor's financial goals, risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Bitcoin has garnered wide acclaim as an asset class due to its impressive returns since inception; yet extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainties and market sentiment sensitivity. Many investors view bitcoin as an intriguing means of diversifying portfolios; due diligence must be performed when considering investing in this cryptocurrency; understanding technology as well as being prepared to accept any potential financial losses are all part of committing oneself to investing. For optimal returns, it would be wise to speak with an advisor regarding tailoring its risk\/reward profile to meet individual investment goals.\nWhat other tokens are worth buying?\nAs Bitcoin price fiercely surges, the other tokens like Ethereum (eth usdt), SEIUSDT (sei usdt), BNB (bnb usdt) etc; will follow the trends. That being said, please do your own research and consult with professional traders before investing or buying tokens.

In the last 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin slipped by $1,134 (roughly Rs. 94,625). With Bitcoin's next halving slated for later this month, market analysts have predicted volatility in the coming weeks.\n“The largest cryptocurrency has reflected a slump in price momentum after experiencing negative net flows into the spot ETFs. The spot ETFs were the main reason for rallies during the first quarter of 2024. With just around two weeks left for halving, we can expect more volatility due to the favourable change in supply dynamics,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, commenting on the market situation.\nEther saw a price drop of 2.15 percent on Thursday, April 4. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,190 (roughly Rs. 2.66 lakh). Over the last 24 hours, the value of ETH had dropped by $72 (roughly Rs. 6,007).\n“ETH like BTC also traded sideways in a smaller timeframe, with $3,200 (roughly Rs. 2.67 lakh) being a key level to hold. Tomorrow's announcement of the US monthly unemployment rate may bring further volatility to the market,” the CoinDCX markets desk told Gadgets360.\nSolana, Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Bitcoin Cash, and Polkadot recorded losses alongside BTC and ETH.\nTron, Polygon, Litecoin, Near Protocol, Uniswap, Leo, and Cosmos also saw losses.\n“While the possibility of a Fed rate cut in June has subdued gains, the consistent rise in stablecoin supply provides a strong reassurance to Bitcoin enthusiasts amid market fluctuations,” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets360.\nThe overall crypto market cap dipped by 0.93 percent in the last 24 hours. It's valuation currently stands at $2.47 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,06,14,496 crore), data by CoinMarketCap showed.\nMeanwhile cryptocurrencies that recorded profits on Thursday included Binance Coin, USD Coin, Monero, and Bitcoin SV.\nCryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle to maintain their positions, FURR stands on the brink of completing a groundbreaking presale offering, poised to deliver up to 15X returns to its early investors. This contrast in trajectories underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto sphere, where new contenders like FURR disrupt the status quo with ambitious promises of growth and innovation.\nBitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster Ride: Will the Bull Run Again Amidst Market Uncertainty?\nBitcoin (BTC) continues its tumultuous journey, currently priced at around $66,288, experiencing a slight 1% dip since yesterday. As the digital gold grapples with ongoing market dynamics, the question on every investor's mind remains: Has the Bitcoin downturn reached its nadir?\nDespite recent corrections, BTC is yet to signal a definitive turnaround, with a fresh daily low just recorded at $64,493. Several factors contribute to this uncertain outlook:\nExcept for BRRR, all ETFs have provided their entry\/exit data, revealing subdued Spot Bitcoin ETF volumes and a modest net inflow of $36 million on April 2. While the outflows from ARKB at $87.5 million dampened optimism, institutional investors likely contributed to the sell-off.\nSince March 18, we haven't witnessed robust net inflows in the ETF channel (excluding March 26). This trend suggests a group of investors in the ETF channel succumbing to increased bearish sentiments, fueled by concerns over pre-halving declines or Genesis sales. BTC's price may lack crucial support from the ETF channel for some time.\nBitcoin failed to close above $71,500, inviting sellers to push it below $69,000. Moreover, there seems to be limited demand at lower levels for now. As Asian investors awaken and US stock markets open, daily volatility spikes, potentially triggering further selling pressure. Additionally, Friday will see crucial US average hourly earnings, non-farm payroll, and unemployment rate data releases. Higher average earnings could signal negative inflation, while strong employment data might bode ill for the Fed's rate cuts. Hence, investors approach Friday cautiously. Moreover, the Silk Road auctions served as a stark reminder of the assets the US holds, indicating that FUDs persist. Ongoing negative developments related to the Coinbase-Binance lawsuit pose potential risks.\nEthereum (ETH) Struggles to Regain Momentum: Will the $3,500 Support Hold Amidst Resistance Challenges?\nEthereum recently showcased a strong upward momentum from the $3,500 support region. However, it is currently trading below the $3,550 level and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average, facing resistance around the $3,550 area on the hourly chart.\nTo continue the recovery, Ethereum must overcome a significant resistance zone at the $3,600 level. Breaking above this level could provide further momentum to its upward movement. However, bears remain active near the $3,650 and $3,680 resistance levels.\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,630 level, followed by critical levels at $3,650 and $3,680. In particular, surpassing the $3,680 resistance level could signify a stronger bullish momentum for Ethereum. Failure to breach the $3,600 resistance may indicate a potential resumption of a downtrend. Currently, the first support level on the downside is around $3,500, with more significant support near $3,475. A break below this level could lead to the next critical support at $3,450, potentially pushing ETH towards $3,340.\nTechnical indicators suggest a maintained bullish trend in the hourly MACD for ETH\/USD, albeit with some loss of momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI is currently below the 50 level, indicating a potential increase in selling pressure. While disappointment may linger for Ethereum investors following recent declines, repeated tests of the $3,500 and below levels in recent times suggest a potential swift recovery in price.\nFurrever Token (FURR) Is About to Finish Its 5th Presale Stage in Record Time\nFurrever Token (FURR) has rapidly gained traction in the crypto market, attracting a significant influx of investors and swiftly completing 50% of all 10 presale stages in under a month.

With 65% of tokens available during the presale, along with clear allocations for DEXs and the team, investors have been provided with a clear understanding of the project's distribution and allocation of funds.\nFurthermore, the project's commitment to security and compliance, evidenced by the smart contract audit and implementation of safety measures, has helped to reassure investors about the safety and integrity of the Furrever Token platform.\nMoreover, the active and engaged community surrounding Furrever Token has played a crucial role in its rapid growth and success.

Gaussian channels are momentum indicators that can be used to identify price tops and bottoms.\n“This is usually the place where things go vertical.”\nLooking at the charts, the analyst suggests that the Wyckoff accumulation schematic is entering Phase E of the pattern, which indicates the markup phase or a period of price rises.\nThe analyst’s Gaussian channel is applied to the market cap of digital assets excluding the top 10 and suggests that the current crypto market is repeating a similar pattern in 2016 and 2020 that preceded a massive uptrend.\nThe analyst also says that Bitcoin is positioned on the weekly chart in relation to key indicators as it was in 2020 before it went on to print new all-time highs (ATHs).\n“Once again at the intersection of the prior ATH and 2x 350-day moving average (DMA), with two-month MACD (moving average convergence divergence) in the green.”\nThe MACD is traditionally used to spot trend reversals and confirm trends.\nLastly, the analyst shares Bitcoin’s two-month chart with the Bollinger bands bandwidth (BBW) indicating the crypto king is on the verge of soaring.\nThe BBW is a price volatility gauge that sees its upper and lower bands widen when volatility declines while the bands contract when volatility is about to explode.\n“Two-month expansion has only just begun.\nAs RSI (Relative Strength Index) has only just crossed the channel EQ (equilibrium).”\nThe analyst’s chart also shows the RSI, a widely used momentum indicator that aims to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.\nBitcoin is trading for 66,117 at time of writing, up slightly in the last 24 hours.\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\nCheck Price Action\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This ambitious target is set against the backdrop of two major upcoming events: the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving and the highly anticipated release of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF. These developments are expected to create waves in the crypto ecosystem, potentially benefiting emergent tokens like Option2Trade (O2T). This analysis delves into Option2Trade (O2T)’s growth strategy, the implications of capturing such a substantial market share, and how the dynamics surrounding the Bitcoin (BTC) halving and Ethereum (ETH) ETF launch could play a pivotal role in Option2Trade (O2T)’s journey towards becoming a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market.\nO2T's Strategic Growth Path\nAt the heart of Option2Trade (O2T)’s promising trajectory is its innovative use of AI-driven technology to enhance trading and investment strategies within the DeFi space. This approach not only sets Option2Trade (O2T) apart from conventional cryptocurrencies but also aligns with the growing demand for platforms that offer intelligent, user-centric investment solutions. Furthermore, O2T's commitment to security, scalability, and interoperability positions it favorably as the crypto market continues to evolve and expand.\nThe Significance of Achieving 3% Market Share\nSecuring 3% of the total cryptocurrency market share is no small feat, considering the vast and varied landscape of digital currencies. Achieving this milestone would not only underscore O2T's value proposition but also solidify its status as a major player in the crypto space. This level of market penetration would likely translate to increased liquidity, higher visibility, and greater investor confidence, all of which are crucial for sustained growth and competitiveness.\nInfluence of Bitcoin (BTC) Halving and Ethereum (ETH) ETF Launch\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) halving and the release of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF are events with far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market. Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) halvings have led to increased market volatility and interest in altcoins, as investors seek to diversify their portfolios in anticipation of potential Bitcoin (BTC) price increases. Similarly, the launch of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF could attract a new wave of institutional and retail investors to the crypto market, elevating interest and investment in altcoins like Option2Trade (O2T).\nFor Option2Trade (O2T), these events represent both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the increased attention and liquidity in the crypto market could propel Option2Trade (O2T) towards achieving its 3% market share goal. On the other hand, the heightened competition and market dynamics require Option2Trade (O2T) to continuously innovate and engage with its user base to maintain momentum.\nConclusion\nThe potential for Option2Trade (O2T) to dominate 3% of the total cryptocurrency market share before the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving and the release of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF is a testament to its ambitious growth strategy and innovative platform. While the road ahead is filled with challenges, the upcoming market events provide a unique opportunity for O2T to accelerate its ascent and establish itself as a key player in the crypto ecosystem. As the market braces for the Bitcoin (BTC) halving and Ethereum (ETH) ETF, the progress of O2T will undoubtedly be a focal point for investors and analysts keen on identifying the next big wave in cryptocurrency investments.\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale: Use promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonusVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\nJoin and become a community member:\nhttps:\/\/t.me\/O2TOfficial https:\/\/twitter.com\/Option2Trade (O2T)\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

This narrative explores the seamless integration of Bitcoin (BTC) within conventional financial sectors and forecasts its trajectory in 2024, juxtaposing its growth against the whimsical rise of memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ).\nBridging the Digital Divide: Bitcoin (BTC) and Traditional Finance\nIn the heart of the financial industry, a transformation unfolds, with Bitcoin (BTC) at its epicenter. Initially perceived as an outsider, Bitcoin (BTC) is now pioneering a symbiotic relationship with traditional finance, facilitating a digital bridge that merges two seemingly disparate worlds. Institutions once wary of Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility are now exploring its potential as a hedge against inflation and a means of diversifying investment portfolios with assets like Shiba Budz (BUDZ).\nThe advent of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs and futures contracts, alongside similar products for memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), marks a significant milestone in this journey, offering both retail and institutional investors a regulated pathway to the crypto market. Moreover, banks and financial services are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) transactions and custody services, while also eyeing the burgeoning market of memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), signaling a shift towards broader acceptance and integration.\nNavigating the Future: BTC Price Predictions for 2024\nAs Bitcoin (BTC) weaves itself into the fabric of traditional finance, the question on everyone's mind is: What does 2024 hold for its price? Experts, analyzing a confluence of adoption rates, regulatory landscapes, and technological advancements, predict a bullish scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024.\nAdoption rates play a pivotal role, with increasing institutional investment and mainstream acceptance serving as key drivers. Regulatory clarity, especially in major economies, is expected to mitigate risks and foster a conducive environment for growth. Meanwhile, technological innovations, such as enhancements in scalability and security, are set to improve Bitcoin's (BTC) utility and appeal, much like the developments around memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ).\nGiven these factors, forecasts suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) could experience substantial growth in 2024, potentially reaching unprecedented highs. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies warrants caution, as external influences can precipitate unforeseen shifts. This sentiment holds true for memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ) as well, whose value can be significantly swayed by social media trends and influencer endorsements.\nBitcoin (BTC) Versus Shiba Budz (BUDZ): A Comparative Trajectory\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) is seen as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, Shiba Budz (BUDZ) represents the playful and speculative side of the crypto world. Bitcoin's (BTC) integration into traditional finance underscores its legitimacy and potential as a long-term investment, a narrative that contrasts sharply with the rapid but often short-lived spikes in value associated with memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ).\nShiba Budz (BUDZ) and other memecoins often exhibit different market dynamics compared to Bitcoin (BTC), providing a broader spectrum of investment opportunities. While Bitcoin (BTC) remains a staple in any crypto portfolio, adding Shiba Budz (BUDZ) can offer a playful yet potentially profitable dimension to your investment strategy.\nConclusion: Embracing the Digital Frontier\nAs we venture into 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) stands at the forefront of a financial revolution, bridging the gap between digital currencies and traditional finance. Its journey, contrasted with the meteoric rises and falls of memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), highlights the diverse and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Investors and enthusiasts alike watch with bated breath as Bitcoin (BTC) continues to unfold its potential, promising a future where digital and traditional finance coalesce. Amidst the speculative fervor surrounding cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) remains a beacon of innovation, charting a course towards a more inclusive and decentralized financial system, with Shiba Budz (BUDZ) carving its own unique path in the vast crypto landscape.\nFor more information on the Shiba Budz (BUDZ) Presale:\nPresale Website: SHIBA BUDZ (BUDZ)\nUse Promo Code budzmoon30 to get 30% bonus\nJoin and become a BUDZ member:\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/ShibaBudzP2E\nTwitter: SHIBA BUDZ \"$BUDZ\" (@ShibaBudz) \/ X\nDisclaimer: The  information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for  investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice,  or trading advice.

From the gleeful to the perplexed to the unimpressed, crypto market watchers know this halving is coming and that it must mean something good for bitcoin.\nThis is a technical event that takes place on the Bitcoin network roughly every four years, cutting the supply of the cryptocurrency in half to create a scarcity effect that makes it like \"digital gold.\" Historically, it sets the stage for a new cycle and bull run – but this one's a little different.\n\"The halving is the ultimate geek event for bitcoiners, but the 2024 iteration takes it up a notch because reduced supply combined with fresh ETF demand creates an explosive cocktail,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo. \"What makes this halving unique is bitcoin has already surpassed the last cycle's high — something it's never done ahead of the quadrennial event — which makes trying to forecast the length and ferocity of this cycle much trickier.\"\nAfter the 2012, 2016 and 2020 halvings, the bitcoin price ran up about 93x, 30x and 8x, respectively, from its halving day price to its cycle top. Past performance isn't indicative of future returns, and some even warn that in dealing with a smaller supply every four years, the days of such a big impact on the bitcoin price are likely already behind us.\nHowever, Steven Lubka, head of private clients and family offices at Swan Bitcoin, said \"if there was ever a moment to be a little extra optimistic\" about returns after the halving, it's this year.\n\"This bitcoin bull cycle — which kicked into gear earlier because of the January approval of the spot ETFs — might well be shorter and more explosive, culminating in a peak in late 2024 or early 2025,\" Trenchev added.\nWhether you seek a deeper understanding of bitcoin as a new, deflationary asset, or you simply want to speculate on the bitcoin price in the coming weeks, here's what you need to know about the halving and its potential impact on the market.\nThe halving occurs when incentives for bitcoin miners are cut by half, as mandated by the code of the Bitcoin blockchain. It's scheduled to take place every 210,000 blocks, or roughly four years.\nAs a refresher, miners run the machines that do the work (essentially solving a very complex math problem) of recording new blocks of bitcoin transactions and adding them to the global ledger, also known as the blockchain.\nMiners have two incentives to mine: transaction fees that are paid voluntarily by senders (for faster settlement) and mining rewards — 6.25 newly created bitcoins, or about $437,500 as of Thursday morning. Sometime between April 18 and April 21, the mining rewards will shrink to 3.125 bitcoins. The incentive was initially 50 bitcoins, but that was reduced to 6.25 in 2020.\nThe reduction in the block rewards leads to a reduction in the supply of bitcoin by slowing the pace at which new coins are created, helping maintain the idea of bitcoin as digital gold — whose finite supply helps determine its value. Eventually, the number of bitcoins in circulation will cap at 21 million, per the Bitcoin code.\nThe halving isn't like an on-off switch that gets flipped at a specific time. Indeed, it's reasonable to think that the day will come and go without much action in the market. Of course, there certainly could be volatility driven by speculators who may be trading on the event. Swan's Lubka warned that investors shouldn't confuse that with the technical change taking place.\n\"I don't think we see a big move either way, but even if there were a big move, it'd have nothing to do mechanically with the halving,\" he said. However, \"in the months that follow, every day there [will be] something like $30 million in bitcoin less being sold. That can build up fast and make an impact over that time period.\"\nThat $30 million assumes a bitcoin price of about $70,000.\nThe one big thing investors need to understand about the halving and its potential impact on the market, Lubka said, is that miners sell a lot of the bitcoin they get paid in order to pay their everyday bills.\n\"These are very costly enterprises that have to consume a lot of energy and other things to do their job,\" he said. \"Miners are constantly selling the bitcoin that they mine just to cover costs. When that gets cut in half, there's no two ways about it: There is half as much bitcoin being sold from the miners.\"\n\"They are the most regular sellers,\" he added. \"Some hedge fund could sell its position … but miners are selling every day, every week, every month in predictable quantity — and that pressure gets cut in half.\"\nBitcoin has always shot to the moon in the months following its halving — that's what makes it such a celebrated day among enthusiasts. However, each time the mining reward and supply of bitcoin has shrunk, so have the returns from the halving day to the cycle top.\n\"Guessing the endgame for bitcoin after each halving is the ultimate sport,\" said Trenchev. \"What we do know is each post-halving bull run has seen diminishing returns. ... Even a measly 2x will put bitcoin around $130,000 — not to be sniffed at.\"\nThat trend could reverse this year, Lubka said, although it'd be the result not of the planned supply shock but rather of the new demand shock. Thanks to the advent of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, demand for the cryptocurrency is bigger than ever, according to CryptoQuant.\nThe data shows that historically, \"whale\" demand for bitcoin spikes after each halving, driving prices higher. This year, however, that whale demand (which includes OG bitcoiners, new investors and bitcoin ETF holders) is already at an all-time high, and the block reward hasn't even been slashed yet.\n\"The once-significant influence of Bitcoin halving on prices has diminished, as the new issuance of bitcoin gets smaller relative to the total amount of bitcoin that is available for sale,\" said Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant. \"In contrast ... bitcoin demand growth seems to be the key driver for higher prices after the halving.\""]}

Cryptocurrencies have captured the attention of everyone alike; traders, non-traders, investors, non-believers, and more. This worldwide phenomenon has only increased as the years went by, with headlines in the news about price surges making it a hot discussion topic among finance folks everywhere. However, many are pondering if the mythical boat to richness in the form of crypto has long passed them. Today, we at Toobit aim to answer the question: is it too late to buy crypto and Bitcoin?The short answer? Of course not! In this article, Toobit experts will break down and explain several reasons as to why this is not the case and why there is always a future in cryptocurrency.\nThe Illusion Of FOMO\nIt's normal to feel like you've missed out on something, especially when that \"something\" is a million dollar investment return. Bitcoin has made a name for itself as the world's first cryptocurrency back in 2009. A lot of non-crypto users (or even non-Bitcoin traders) share a misconception, one that assumes that because Bitcoin is so popular and doing well now (currently at $70,000 for a piece.) that it must be too late to even bother with it at all. In fact, this leads to FOMO (the abbreviation of the phrase \"fear of missing out\") especially when faced with handsome profit returns. The mistake that most users make is panic-buy crypto upon hearing this news, thus leading to the infamous FOMO regret. Trading is a big deal; don't waste money that could potentially be used for future gains! It is very important to remember that investing is not a decision that can be made on emotional impulse, but rather a steady and calculated move.\nVolatility, Bear Markets, & The Waiting Game\nFact: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Don't let that scare you from dipping your toes into the pond though! Bitcoin's growth is nothing short of remarkable, facing significant downturns for most of its years before eventually skyrocketing. However, this is the reality of investing in crypto; you are most likely going to face a lot of downs before you see any upturns. Investing in cryptocurrency requires a strong stomach and a long-tern perspective. No one got rich overnight from crypto... Unless they were incredibly lucky. It's all about timing, and for most crypto investors; we're all playing the waiting game. Be patient and think about how long it took Bitcoin to get where it is today. Try to adopt a more disciplined approach towards trading whenever you start to feel the itch to sell. Last but not least, always be prepared for fluctuations! The crypto seas can be rough, but it's one helluva view when you make it to the other side of the Bitcoin rainbow.Now, let's address the question of whether it's too late to buy crypto and Bitcoin specifically.\nBitcoin: Is It Too Late?\nBitcoin, often dubbed digital gold by financial experts, has established itself as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. 21 million coins currently are out in the world, however that number is reducing day by day with miners working hard to claim block rewards while they still can. Its finite supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive asset for investors seeking alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. Due to its nature of being scarce, a lot of traders are of the opinion that it is too late to get on the Bitcoin boat, as it has long left the pier. While the price of Bitcoin has reached unprecedented highs, many experts believe that its potential for further growth remains substantial, especially as adoption continues to increase. So with all this acceptance and positive news about Bitcoin, why are the non-believers so adamant that it's all over?A large reason for this belief is none other than the Bitcoin halving event. Whenever the Bitcoin halving occurs, the price movements of Bitcoin become more desirable--at a certain cost. As of now, April 2024, users are about to witness another Bitcoin halving occur. With the last Bitcoin halving occurring in May 2020, the block height is about to drop yet again very soon.Which now begs the question: how does the Bitcoin halving work?\nUnderstanding The Bitcoin Halving\nScheduled to occur approximately once every 4 years, the Bitcoin halving event is one of the biggest things to happen in the cryptocurrency world. But what exactly is the Bitcoin halving, and why does it matter? At its core, the Bitcoin halving is a built-in feature of the cryptocurrency's protocol that occurs roughly every 210,000 blocks. This event involves reducing the reward miners receive for validating transactions by half. In simpler terms, it means that the rate at which new Bitcoins are created is cut in half.\nWhen Was The Last Bitcoin Halving?\nTo put it into perspective, since May 2020 (which was the previous Bitcoin halving event) the block rewards have been halved to 6.25 Bitcoins per block. This means that by a date in April 2024, Bitcoin would have reached 210,000 blocks again, thus halving the 6.25 Bitcoins per block into 3.125 Bitcoins per block as the block reward. To know when Bitcoin will halve again, its best to have a Bitcoin halving countdown clock so that you can always be prepared for the next one! As for the exact date, it isn't completely accurate as the rate Bitcoins are mined may differ depending on the source of data. However, you can use any Bitcoin halving countdown clocks online as a reference for an estimated date.\nWhy Is The Bitcoin Halving An Important Event?\nYou might wonder why Bitcoin even bothers to employ such an exhausting mechanism. Well, there are several reasons but the best way to understand this is to know that it's the best way to control the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation. Unlike fiat currency, which is known to suffer inflation thanks to central banks printing more and more money to circulate it, Bitcoin maintains its scarcity by nature. In face through the Bitcoin halving, along with halving the rewards gained from block rewards, the rate of new Bitcoin issuance is gradually reducing over time. Bitcoin's creators sought to mimic the scarcity of precious metals like gold, thereby potentially increasing its value over time. Therefore, with every Bitcoin halving, the price movements of Bitcoin only increase gradually. This is the biggest reason why it is far more valuable than fiat currency, and why Bitcoin has such fantastic value.\nWhat To Know Before Investing in Crypto and Bitcoin\nThe Bitcoin halving event has significant implications for both Bitcoin investors and enthusiasts alike. Here are a few key points to consider, especially if you are new to trading and cryptocurrency:1. Supply and Demand Dynamics: With the reduction in the supply of newly minted Bitcoins, the event often leads to increased scarcity. Basic economics dictates that when the supply of an asset decreases while demand remains constant or increases, its price tends to rise. Therefore, some investors anticipate that the Bitcoin halving event will drive up the price of Bitcoin.2. Historical Performance: Previous Bitcoin halving events have been associated with significant price movements for Bitcoin. However, it's essential to note that while we may learn from it, past performance is not indicative of future results. Historical trends can still provide valuable insights, so we should not completely push it aside, but always keep in mind that they do not guarantee similar outcomes in the future.3. Market Sentiment: The lead-up to the halving typically sparks heightened speculation and volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Traders and investors are advised to closely monitor Bitcoin price movements and market sentiment, and attempt to capitalize on potential opportunities, or alternatively mitigate risks associated with any sudden increased volatility.As Bitcoin approaches its next halving, the crypto community eagerly anticipates its potential impact on the market. While opinions vary on the event's precise implications, one thing remains clear: the Bitcoin halving is only the beginning to understanding its unique value proposition and its status as a decentralized digital asset. As for other cryptocurrencies, the landscape is vast and varied. With new tokens popping up daily, it can get overwhelming to keep up with every new crypto project. While some crypto projects show promise and innovation, others may be speculative or even fraudulent. As exciting as this new world is, conducting thorough research and due diligence is essential before investing in any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.\nThe Future Of Crypto\nThe cryptocurrency market is still relatively young and evolving. This means that factos such as regulatory developments, technological advancements, and shifts in investor sentiment can all impact prices and market dynamics. Therefore, it's crucial for investors to stay informed and adapt to changing conditions. After all, cryptocurrency is barely a teenager in investment age!Ultimately, whether it's too late to buy crypto and Bitcoin depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

This article provides a detailed analysis of these cryptocurrencies, highlighting their current market positions, underlying value propositions, and potential future directions.\nBitcoin's Market Value: A Comparative Analysis\nOn April 10, 2024, the value of a single bitcoin reached an impressive milestone, exceeding $70,000, with a specific value of $70,665. The total circulation of bitcoin at this time was over 19.68 million, culminating in a market capitalization exceeding $1.39 trillion. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, where the market cap was around $472 billion with approximately 19.35 million bitcoins in circulation.\nTo understand the proportion of global wealth represented by bitcoin, it's crucial to consider the overall monetary wealth. According to calculations by Credit Suisse, global wealth was estimated at $454.4 trillion by the end of 2022. Assuming a steady growth rate, the total global wealth by 2024 would be around $469.8 trillion, placing bitcoin at 0.3% of this figure.\nGold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset. With an estimated 244,000 tons of gold discovered to date and a price per ounce of $2,334.90 as of April 10, 2024, the total value of all gold amounted to approximately $18.23 trillion. In this context, bitcoin's total value represented about 7.6% of the total value of all gold.\nWhile bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it is far from the only one. Including other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies was around $2.6 trillion as of April 10, 2024. This constituted roughly 0.56% of the total global money supply.\nCryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are known for their volatility, liquidity issues, and susceptibility to price manipulation. Potential investors are advised to thoroughly understand the risks associated with these digital assets.\nBitcoin, as a pioneering cryptocurrency, occupies a unique position in the global financial ecosystem. Its comparison to traditional assets like gold highlights its growing relevance and potential as a store of value, despite constituting a small fraction of the world's total monetary wealth. As the digital currency landscape evolves, bitcoin continues to be a significant player, reflecting broader trends in the move towards virtual assets.\nEthereum's Price Recovery: A Path to $3,600\nEthereum has shown resilience by holding above the crucial $3,400 support zone, indicating a possible recovery from recent losses. However, to sustain an upward trajectory in the near term, it must breach the $3,600 mark.\nThe digital currency witnessed a downturn, dipping below the $3,500 threshold and momentarily breaching the $3,450 support level. Ethereum found its lowest point at $3,408 before initiating a recovery, paralleling Bitcoin's upward movement. This recovery saw Ethereum surpass the $3,500 resistance, reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from its previous high of $3,726 to its low of $3,408. Additionally, Ethereum managed to break through a downward trend line on the ETH\/USD hourly chart, signaling a potential reversal of the bearish trend.\nEthereum currently hovers around the $3,500 mark, closely aligned with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a balanced market sentiment. Immediate resistance is identified near $3,600, correlating with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high to low swing.\nShould Ethereum overcome the $3,650 resistance, it might target the $3,725 level, setting the stage for a possible move towards $3,780. A decisive break above $3,800 could catalyze a bullish momentum, possibly propelling the price to the $3,880 zone and, in an optimistic scenario, to the $4,000 mark.\nConversely, failure to surpass the $3,600 resistance could trigger a new round of selling. Immediate support is found near $3,520, with significant support at the $3,500 and $3,400 levels. A breach below $3,400 might lead to a decline towards $3,320, and further losses could potentially push the price down to $3,240.\nFurrever Token: A Charming Alternative in the Cryptocurrency World\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves as an innovative alternative to the more traditional altcoins. Standing out with a unique blend of charm and community spirit, FURR is distinguishing itself amidst giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).\nWhat sets Furrever Token apart is its commitment to adding a touch of charisma to the crypto industry. Moving beyond mere transactions and functionalities, FURR captures the hearts of its users with enchanting digital cat imagery, offering an enjoyable and lighthearted experience. This not only differentiates FURR from its counterparts but also fosters a sense of community and collective enjoyment among its enthusiasts.\nAt its heart, Furrever Token prioritizes creating a welcoming and inclusive community. The introduction of cat-themed visuals, stickers, and emojis into its platform not only enhances user engagement but also promotes a sense of unity and camaraderie among its members. This focus on community building is a cornerstone of FURR's strategy, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a shared experience.\nFurrever Token's approach to token distribution is equally impressive, with about 9 billion tokens in total supply. A significant 65% of these tokens are allocated for a presale, aimed at ensuring a broad and fair distribution. Additionally, locking 10% of the total supply for a year underscores the team's dedication to the project's longevity and the trust of its community.\nThe market has responded favorably to Furrever Token, with over $720,000 raised within a month of its launch. This remarkable feat underscores FURR's growing appeal and its viability as an investment in the crypto market. With its price currently at $0.00048, Furrever Token demonstrates a steadily increasing value, attracting the attention of investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike.\nFurrever Token (FURR) presents a compelling case for those looking for an alternative in the cryptocurrency space. Through its unique charm, strong community focus, and thoughtful tokenomics, FURR is carving out a niche for itself against competitors like Solana and Ethereum. As it continues to build momentum, Furrever Token stands as a testament to the potential of innovative and engaging approaches in the world of digital currencies.\nWrapping Up\nThe cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and complex ecosystem, with Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate the landscape, while new entrants like Furrever Token offer fresh perspectives and opportunities. As these digital currencies evolve, they reflect broader trends towards virtual assets and the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. Investors and enthusiasts alike are advised to stay informed and consider the unique characteristics and potential of each cryptocurrency.

Here's what experts and community members are saying about th..."],"article_contents":["Oops, something went wrong\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nOn April 19, or whenever a bitcoin miner mines block number 840,000, the amount of bitcoin {{BTC}} entering into circulation will halve from about 900 a day to 450. This event, colloquially known as the halving (sometimes halvening), looms large in the Bitcoin mindshare, one of those things that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Perhaps because it only comes around on Leap Years (so far), bitcoiners tend to look forward to the halving more than most crypto holidays like Bitcoin Pizza Day or the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the white paper. But it won't be around forever.\nThis roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.\nOnce all 21 million bitcoins are mined, the halving will have served its purpose and cease (likely in 2140). Why did Nakamoto make it this way? No one knows. Just like there's no real insight into why he chose a 21 million cap or Jan. 9 as launch day. There are many, many guesstimates that try to make sense of these seemingly arbitrary elements of Bitcoin's design. Because if there's one thing certain about Bitcoin, it's that it tends to split opinions.\nAnd so, with an event as anticipated as the halving there are certainly things to argue over. Is it \"priced in\" (meaning will the reduction in supply of bitcoins entering the market cause a rally)? Will the reduced revenues drive bitcoin miners bankrupt? Will this time be any different?\nCoinDesk turned to the crypto community to get their say:\nHaseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital:\nI am a longtime halving nihilist. The halving is *what it means* for bitcoin to be deflationary. It's been priced in since the first time someone bought bitcoin because it has a fixed supply. The timing of the halving has been baked in since Bitcoin was first launched six years ago.\nPeople drawing charts and rainbows and all this nonsense over an event that has deterministically happened four times (on an asset that already goes up almost every single year) is pseudoscientific nonsense. But whatever, it's a good story.\nAustin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School:\nAs bitcoin gains more of a foothold in traditional finance, events that were drivers of past cycles like the halving will cease to have as much of an impact, if any. Portfolio allocators think in multi-year and multi-decade terms, and the impact of events like the halving will be muted as this market segment grows, just like any market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.\nAzeem Khan, co-founder of Morph:\nMy personal opinion is the halving is likely priced in. We’ve seen institutional capital inflows for months now since the bitcoin spot ETF was approved. And even before that we were seeing a lot of liquidity enter the market without seeing traditional signs that retail was buying with things like Coinbase being the number one app in the App Store. To me, that indicated it was already institutional money coming in. They’re not dumb and have likely been buying ahead of this. Larry Fink didn’t get to where he is by accident.\nMy personal philosophy in this space has tended to be that when everyone agrees something is going to happen, it generally doesn’t. Similar to when we had Elon being a clown on SNL pumping $DOGE in 2021 and everyone had agreed it was going to $1, it dumped.\nThe investing approach I abide by has always been to dollar cost average. Pick an amount you’re willing to lose, set an auto buy for that amount of whichever assets you’ve done your research on, continue to buy over the long term every X period, and never look at the price. If you’re investing with a long term approach in mind, this will help you beat out 99% of the noise you see from gambling addicts, some of which turned out to be the lottery winners of Crypto Twitter when zooming out through the years.\nEdan Yago, founder of Sovryn:\nDefinitely not priced in. Not even close. This is the most important halving since the first. This halving will bring new assets to Bitcoin in the form of Runes and the coming cycle will see Bitcoin Rollups add scalability and programmability to Bitcoin. Bitcoin block space will go from cheap to the scarcest computing resource in the world.\nOgle, founder of Glue:\nI think this halving is distinct from prior ones because of the significant increase in capital coming into the market because of the ETF approvals. So you have a reduction of supply because of the halving itself, combined with increased demand from the ETFs — basic economic principles say this should result in a higher price. My guess is the halving has partially been priced in, but I don't think people quite realize the magnitude of buy pressure that is coming in via the ETFs — and that buy pressure is in my view going to significantly impact the price of BTC upward.\nUncle Rockstar Developer, core contributor to BTCPay:\nGiven the historical data — 9,575% increase post-2012, 3,233% post-2016, and 667% post-2020 — it's not a question of if the BTC\/USD price will rise after this halving, but rather by how much. Feel free to quote me on that.\nEd Hindi, chief investment officer at Tyr Capital:\nBitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets. The ETF is currently spearheading this doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth.\nWe believe that price action ahead and post-halving is going to be different from past events as there are new variables affecting bitcoin. The combination of an uncertain geopolitical situation, choppy U.S. spot ETF flows, record leverage and recalibration of the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy is going to create an explosive combo and lead to extremely volatile market conditions. We would not be surprised to see BTC trade as low as $55,000 and as high as $75,000 in the coming couple of weeks. We remain very bullish into year-end though and consider $120,000 to be a realistic target.\nRoger Ver, creator of Bitcoin Cash:\nNothing special happened for the last three halvings. I don’t expect this time to be any different.\nSee also: The Bitcoin Halving Really Is Different This Time\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of Komodo Platform:\nThe biggest difference between the 2020 halving and the 2024 halving is skyrocketing institutional demand. Prior to the previous halving, institutions were on the sidelines. The market was dominated by retail investors. Since then, the market dynamic has drastically shifted. As one example, MicroStrategy didn’t make its first BTC purchase until August 2020. As of April 2024, the company reportedly holds 214, 246 BTC (roughly $13.625 billion). Of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, around 12.27% currently belong to publicly traded and private companies, ETFs and countries.\nAdam Blumberg, co-founder of Interaxis:\nThe halving will have likely an impact on the price, as we have greater demand than ever from ETF investors, bitcoin hodlers and even corporations, and we're coupling that with decreasing new supply. We'll also see impact on miners who have tremendous capital and electricity outlays, and will get their production cut in half.\nColin Harper, researcher and writer for Luxor Technology’s Hashrate Index:\nThis halving could be unprecedented with regards to how it affects Bitcoin's total network hashrate. It's plausible that we see no hashrate come offline after the halving, or that we will see the smallest decrease in network hashrate after any other halving event in Bitcoin's history. Mining margins won't be as good after the halving as they are now, obviously, but they won't be horrendous. And if the new Runes fungible token protocol makes a significant impact on transaction fees, then margins will be healthy enough to keep miners with higher costs online for longer than not.\nFor comparison, Bitcoin's hash rate declined 15% after the 2020 halving, 5% after 2016's halving, and 13% after 2012.\nSee also: Why Bitcoin Halving Calculators Are Out of Sync\nJoe Downie, chief marketing officer at NiceHash:\nThis halving is different, we will likely see less volatility than previous ones, for a few reasons: one is that Bitcoin mining is far stronger than it has ever been before in terms of hashrate, another is the level of legitimacy Bitcoin has gotten recently due to institutional funds and ETFs, plus the fact that a lot of people are in “wait and see” mode. This makes for a far more stable basis for BTC to hold its current value and gradually increase over the course of this year. There may be some short term volatility during the following week or two after the halving, but I expect things to stabilize quickly after that.\nTroy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College:\nThere are two sides of the halving story: price impact and mining impact. On the price side, I don't have anything to say. The \"supply shock *should* be priced in, but every time I have thought that and every time I've been wrong. I won't pretend to read the collective psyche. With everyone anticipating that everyone else is irrational and *not* pricing it in, who knows what will happen?\nI tweeted recently about the U.S. government’s holdings of bitcoin, over 200,000 bitcoins, and much of it Silk Road seizure. In terms of the impact on supply, that's at least as important as the halving event.\nBut on the mining side, the halving does get me excited.\nThe halving will force miners to seek out even cheaper power than they already have. Some miners will go under, selling off their equipment to those with more efficient operations.\nThe breakeven point for profitably running an ASIC will nearly drop in half. Miners will start curtailing more often, particularly their older machines.\nWhat happens next depends on bitcoin's price action, but if prices do not rise dramatically, we will see a dip in hashrate while ASICs find cheaper homes, and then mining will settle into its \"dung beetle\" role, consuming only wasted, stranded energy.\nThe differences between a cost-sensitive consumer of energy like bitcoin and traditional data centers or AI data centers--or really any other electricity consumer--are already clear, but after the halving, bitcoin's flexibility — shutting down whenever electricity prices rise — and its opportunism, finding pockets of currently-stranded energy, bottlenecked by transmission constraints, will be even more dramatic.\nMaria Bustillos, founder of Flaming Hydra, a part of the Brick House co-op:\nI just hope this finally, FINALLY gets people reckoning the gigantic difference in environmental costs between PoW and PoS blockchains.\nPeter Todd, founder of OpenTimestamps and Bitcoin Core developer:\nThe halving is one of the dumbest parts of how Bitcoin was designed. If you're going to reduce subsidy over time, the right way to do it is gradually, rather than shocking the system every four years. Fortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.\nFortunately fees are getting higher, so the risk of havings is reducing. Hopefully this one goes alright.\nZooko Wilcox, founder of Zcash:\nI’m interested in the Bitcoin halving because of supply effects. I have come to frankly detest that part of the markets which is independent of fundamentals. You know what I mean: hype, narrative, people buying when they see something go up and selling when they see something go down. The Keynesian Beauty Contest, the Greater Fool Theory. Memecoins. Memestocks. Pump and dumps. Insider trading. Misinformation\/disinformation\/FUD. I was always naturally against such stuff, but my long painful experience in the crypto world has made me hate it.\nBitcoin’s and Zcash’s assured supply limits is the very opposite of that — the thing that no amount of hype or misinformation or mass mania can touch. And it’s interesting to think about the difference between talking about the supply of Bitcoin and Zcash being 21 million, versus talking about it being the ongoing addition to the supply from mining.\nAlex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital:\nThe Bitcoin halving is the programmatic mechanism that creates and enforces bitcoin’s most famous quality: its scarcity. While this fourth halving reduction in new daily issuance from ~900 BTC to ~450 BTC is small in absolute terms and relative to BTC’s daily float of $10-$25 billion, nonetheless prices are set on the margin. But beyond any supply impact – which I believe is marginal – this is the first halving in which major U.S. asset managers are educating on Bitcoin, and there’s no better Bitcoin education than learning about the halving. It’s a narrative event first – a quadrennial market moment – and a supply event second, though I think both aspects will be impactful.\nTatiana Koffman, general partner at Moonwalker Capital and author of the Myth of Money newsletter:\nThe most significant impact of the Bitcoin halving is its influence on the energy input and mining difficulty of Bitcoin, which inherently supports a higher baseline price for the cryptocurrency.\nThis phenomenon can be closely likened to gold mining, where the principle of scarcity plays a crucial role. As more gold is extracted, the remaining reserves become increasingly scarce, making it more challenging and costly to find and extract new deposits. This requires more investment in exploration and advanced machinery for mining and processing the gold.\nSee also: Will the Next Bitcoin Halving Be Another Hype Cycle?\nSimilarly, Bitcoin's scarcity is engineered through a difficulty adjustment algorithm that halves the mining rewards roughly every four years. This not only reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced but also adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a steady rate of block creation, regardless of the total computational power on the network. This mechanism ensures that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, the effort and cost to mine it increase, supporting its price over time.\nThe halving mechanism is fundamental to preserving Bitcoin's integrity as a store of value. It underscores the cryptocurrency's deflationary nature, which is critical for its long-term valuation and the security of its network. By intentionally reducing the influx of new Bitcoins, the halving events reinforce Bitcoin's status as a digital equivalent of gold, making it a potentially attractive option for future generations looking for reliable value preservation in the face of inflationary fiat currencies.\nBradley Rettler, philosophy professor at the University of Wyoming:\nThe bitcoin halving has two purposes. The first is to attract attention, thereby drawing ever more people into the network. The second is to reassure people that the rules are still in charge.\nAnil Lulla, co-founder of Delphi Digital:\nI think the halving is always just a great marketing event built into Bitcoin every four years. It obviously has an impact on its supply, but more than that it gets everyone to pay attention to the asset and how it works. I think this halving is extra special because of two things (1) The ETF and (2) the Bitcoin Renaissance happening right now. The ETF is straightforward and widely covered, so I’ll focus on (2). Ordinals, Runes and BRC-20s. I don’t think the Bitcoin ecosystem has had this much excitement around it in years. It’s driving a lot of attention, experimentation and innovation to Bitcoin at a time when it’s much needed.\nBurak Tamac, adjunct professor at Montclair State University:\nThe Bitcoin halving reduces barriers to adoption in three key ways:\n1. The concept is not only easy to understand, but we need something to contrast when learning new concepts.\n2. Comparing the halving to fiat money supply highlights the direct contrast between the two. However, these two factors alone won't drive rapid mass adoption. This is where the third point becomes crucial:\n3. It is also very easy to explain. New bitcoiners can quickly understand and convincingly share the concept with others.\nWhat distinguishes this halving is that not only bitcoiners but also major financial institutions have been educating their clients about its importance.\nDavid Zane Morris, editor of the Dark Markets newsletter:\nI expect a price rise after the halving, largely thanks to the new ETFs. There are a lot of new investors who are still learning the nuances of Bitcoin, and there is now a very easy way for them to buy into sentiment or narratives. That lack of friction is the truly new factor here, and I expect it to matter.\nJames Wester, a tech analyst at Javelin Strategy:\nThis halving is definitely coming at an interesting time as we are still figuring out the effects of the bitcoin ETFs on demand. That makes it harder to determine how much of the halving is effectively priced in. That said, all of the issues that have gotten us here still remain--the ETFs, institutional interest--so it is reasonable to believe that demand will continue to drive the price up in the longer term.\nAubrey Strobel, advisor to Trust Machines, Lolli and Pubkey:\nConsider this — in just a span of three or four months, we've witnessed the launch of 11 bitcoin ETFs, with four of them marking the most successful debuts in history. The combined capital in these ETFs has already exceeded 50% of the assets under management (AUM) in gold, a milestone achieved in a fraction of the time it took for gold to reach its current status over 20 years. Now, with only 450 new bitcoins entering the market daily, coupled with significant investments from major asset managers like Fidelity, Blackrock and also Michael Saylor, the demand-supply dynamics are evident. It's simple math to anticipate the trajectory ahead.\nMolly White, author the Citation Needed newsletter:\nAlthough responsible investment advisers will often warn that \"past performance is no guarantee of future results\", that's largely the kind of thought process that goes into predictions for the halving. \"Number went up last time, so number go up again\". More sophisticated explainers might delve into supply and demand, suggesting that the gradual closing of the bitcoin faucet amid roughly steady demand is what drives prices higher. Either way, some people are piling into bitcoin in belief of guaranteed double-your-money returns, if not better.\nThese folks might do well to be a bit more cautious.\nSee also: How the Bitcoin Halving Could Affect Network Security\nGwern, polymath: Bitcoin has been boring for a long time. I can't think of a single thing about Bitcoin in the past four years I'd actually feel excited to write about. even stuff like Lightning slowly whimpering out should've been old news in 2020.\nBennett Tomlin, head of research at Protos:\nThe Bitcoin halving serves the important function of reducing the incentives to waste energy on Bitcoin and ensuring that many poorly run bitcoin miners will once again be forced to confront the challenging economics of their businesses.\nBitfinex'ed, Tether critic:\nIt’s not events that dictate price in crypto, prices in this market are determined by the heads of the market, notably Tether and their co-conspirators.\nIf you want a quote from an influential person, Giancarlo Devasini, the CFO of Tether.\n“Illiquid markets such as bitcoin are easy prey for manipulation”, being as the primary trading pair is Tether and not the U.S. dollar, the prices are whatever he wants them to be.\nUPDATE (APRIL 16, 2024): Adds quotes from Maria Bustillos, Aubrey Strobel, James Wester, David Zane Morris and Zooko Wilcox."]}

However, this time around, Glassnode says BTC’s price may experience volatility due to three key factors.\n“Historically, halvings have led to major market rallies by cutting the supply of new Bitcoins, thus potentially increasing prices due to higher demand.\nHowever, this time, the dynamics are further complicated by heavy institutional involvement through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and notable shifts in the activities of long-term investors and ‘smart money’ entities.\nThese factors collectively suggest a more nuanced market response to the upcoming halving:\nBitcoin is trading for $60,578 at time of writing, a 2.17% decrease during the last 24 hours.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nCategories\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nJOIN US ON X\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl","April 17, 2024 07:36 ET\n\n\n | Source:\r\n            \nFurrever Token\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token\nNew York City, NY, April  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The markets have been bleeding out over the past couple of days, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a 2% dip in their prices. However, amidst this downturn, Furrever Token (FURR)  has emerged as a bright spot, surpassing the significant milestone of  $800,000 during its sixth presale stage. This contrast highlights the  dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where while some major  players face temporary setbacks, newer projects like FURR demonstrate  resilience and potential for growth.\nBitcoin Faces Geopolitical Headwinds Amidst Price Volatility: Dipped 3.4% Since Yesterday\nBitcoin's  recent attempt at recovery was abruptly halted yesterday afternoon  following renewed geopolitical risks, causing the digital asset to turn  downwards once again. The largest cryptocurrency witnessed a 3.4%  decline, retracing its gains from the previous day and closing around  the $63,400 mark. Today, Bitcoin briefly dipped to the $61,000 range  before bouncing back to the $63,000 zone with the opening of the  European session. Amidst continued volatile movements in the Bitcoin  market, significant liquidations persist in futures crypto trading, with  $274 million worth of positions closed in the past 24 hours, 200  million of which were long positions, indicating investors' maintained  optimism despite the downward trend.\nExternally-driven  news dominates the Bitcoin market, with a brief upward movement towards  $66,000 seen after the Hong Kong news yesterday, but this positive  development was short-lived. However, investors are keeping a close eye  on the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 20th, anticipating its  potential impact on Bitcoin's supply dynamics and market sentiment.\nEthereum Faces Crucial Support Levels Amid Market Turmoil\nAmidst  a widespread selloff in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) faces  scrutiny as its price dips by 2% to approximately $3,059, according to  coinmarketcap.com. With attention turning to critical support levels,  renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a pivotal zone between  $2,000 and $2,430, where 9.37 million addresses collectively hold nearly  53 million ETH. Martinez's analysis underscores the significance of  this range in determining Ethereum's price direction amidst market  volatility.\nDespite  the downturn, optimism persists within the crypto community, buoyed by  recent regulatory approvals such as Hong Kong's green light for Bitcoin  and Ethereum ETFs. Moreover, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming  Bitcoin Halving event adds intrigue, although concerns over short-term  volatility linger. As investors navigate uncertain terrain, Martinez's  insights offer valuable guidance, emphasizing the importance of  monitoring market dynamics and expert analyses.\nAmidst  the price dip, Ethereum's one-day trading volume remains near the  flatline at $22.42 billion, with the ETH price down 7.48% over the last  24 hours and nearly 16% over the last seven days. The Ethereum Futures  Open Interest has also declined by 6.01% to $10.91 billion, indicating  ongoing market turbulence.\nFurrever Token (FURR): Riding the Wave of Market Downturn with Resilience\nDespite the broader market downturn, Furrever Token (FURR)  stands out as a beacon of resilience, navigating the choppy waters of  the crypto landscape with unwavering momentum. Surpassing the  significant milestone of $800,000 during its sixth presale stage, FURR  demonstrates a remarkable ability to thrive amidst market volatility.  This success can be attributed to the project's unique value  proposition, centered around infusing the crypto space with an  irresistible dose of cuteness.

As investors and traders seek to anticipate the volatile movements of Bitcoin, innovative approaches are continuously explored. One such method involves leveraging Google Trends data to gauge public interest and sentiment towards Bitcoin. This approach assumes that search volume on Google not only reflects current interest but can also serve as a predictive tool for future price movements. This blog post delves into the intricacies of using Google Trends as a sentiment predictor, exploring its potential to forecast  Bitcoin prices and discussing the broader implications of sentiment analysis in the financial market.\nWe especially liked older paper by Wang, (2018), where he used media news as a proxy for attention from the information supply side and Google search as a proxy for attention from the information demand side.\nCryptocurrency anomalies can be explained by behavioral theories emphasizing noise trader risks rather than fundamental ones. (Yang, 2019) in his Behavioral Anomalies in Cryptocurrency Markets, they examined and observed that if behavioral biases explain asset pricing anomalies, they are to also materialize in cryptocurrency markets within testing over 20 stock return anomalies based on daily cryptocurrency data and document strong evidence of price momentum, which is statistically significant.\nIn our own house research, we also found some evidence for trend-following and mean-reversion effects.\nOf course, the strong influence of sentiment and news got its way into crypto markets and, to some extent, is driven and even exacerbated by retail investors. Here, we will present two articles from our blog that summarize the importance of the sentiment and news on the cryptocurrency’s market price action:\nThe selected measure of sentiment is Google Trends because it is free and respected as an objective source of data and information about the popularity of any topic. It is often used (for example, in social science studies), easy to analyze and readily available, more accessible than any other news-based sentiment measures (which are often also paid).\nInspired by the above-mentioned research, we created the Crypto Sentiment Index (CSI), built as the equally weighted average of the normalized search interest over time for a list of keywords related to the cryptocurrency market. Our sentiment index is constructed using the following keywords (separated by a comma):\nblockchain, nft (or non fungible token), bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, cryptocurrency, hodl, altcoin, defi (decentralized finance), fomo, initial coin offering, stablecoin, mining pool, pump and dump, satoshi nakamoto, bitcoin mining, shitcoin\nWe started collecting data in January 2004, and our sample ends in October 2023. However, for each keyword, we need to recalculate Google Trends’ “relative measure of interest at the end of the sample (October 2023)” to the “relative measure of interest in each month.” Why do we need to do that?\nGoogle Trends returns data in the form of % as the relative interest in the topic over time. Imagine that you want to gauge the relative interest of the people using Google Search for the word “pandemic” in October 2023. When you download the data from Google Trends, there is a notable peak for the word in the year 2020, which is understandable (COVID-19 pandemic). Google Trends shows that the interest in the word “pandemic” in October 2023 was 4% of the peak (March 2020, when it hit 100%). The 4% in October 2023 is the correct measure of interest (sentiment) compared to the highest peak that was experienced.\nBut what about the interest (sentiment) of 3% that was experienced in April 2016? It is the correct measure of the interest in the word “pandemic” after the March 2020 COVID-19 peak. However, in April 2016, COVID-19 didn’t exist. The 3% interest\/sentiment number in April 2016 can’t be compared to the peak of March 2020. We must rescale\/recalculate this interest (sentiment) to the highest experienced peak in data up to that date. The highest peak in interest in the word “pandemic” before April 2016 was experienced in April 2009 (16% of the COVID-19 peak from March 2020). Therefore, the correct measure of interest (sentiment) for April 2016 isn’t 3%, but rather 3% * 100\/16 = 18.75%.\nIn April 2016, Google Trends showed that interest in the word “pandemic” was ~19%, and the highest peak in data in April 2009 showed 100% interest. In October 2023, Google Trend showed that interest in the word “pandemic” was ~3%, the highest peak in data in March 2020 showed 100% interest and April 2016 peak was just 16%.\nWe hope you now understand the necessity to pre-process the Google Trends data for each selected cryptocurrency keyword for each month before averaging the interest\/sentiment measures into one equally-weighted measure.\nSo, how did we do it? For each keyword, we used the initial period of January 2004 to January 2017 as the “measuring period”, found the maximum number in the data, and recalculated what’s the January 2017 interest\/sentiment number to the peak up to that date. Then, we iteratively increased the “measuring period” month by month and recalculated\/normalized each month’s interest\/sentiment to the measuring window’s peak. This way, we created a “relative measure of interest in each month“, and we then equally weighted numbers for each keyword to produce the final Crypto Sentiment Index (CSI). And this is how the resultant index look like:\nOur research idea is to investigate the influence of sentiment change on Bitcoin price. Since earlier studies have shown that sentiment measure is not the only factor that influences Bitcoin prices, we tried to find a relationship with a combination of sentiment and trend.\nThis is our benchmark performance: pure plain performance of Bitcoin (BTC) during the considered period:\n(On the y-axis, you can find its price in thousands of USD [$].)\nWe test trading strategy on a monthly data and the trading decision is always made at the end of the month. Now, we have four scenarios we considered, and we will briefly introduce and explain their meaning:\nSo, how did each of those rules perform? Let’s just go straight into the evaluation! The Y-axis now shows an appreciation of $1 invested into each strategy variant based on the rules described earlier.\nIt is not hard to see that the best combination is when past sentiment and past price trend are both positive. Alternatively, we can try to extract performance from short-term reversal factors – sentiment and past performance are simultaneously negative. Therefore, as a final strategy, we chose the combination of A + D.\nNow, we can compare the final strategy with the Buy & Hold (HODL) approach of Bitcoin.\nThe mixed A+D model is the winner, with better performance and risk metrics. The resultant strategy achieves nice participation in the BTC price runups when the sentiment and price trends point in the same direction. Additionally, it quickly invests in the mean reversion scenarios when the price and sentiment are both negative, which helps it retain a significant part of the BTC performance (even outperforming). Tactical switch out of the BTC market when the sentiment and trend signals do not agree helps to decrease the risk (volatility and drawdowns). Overall, it seems that sentiment measures can be an interesting predictor in the mostly retail-driven crypto markets. Adding the sentiment signal to the pure price signal may help improve models based on past performances.\nAuthor:Lukáš Zelieska, Quant Analyst, Quantpedia.comCyril Dujava, Quant Analyst, Quantpedia.com\nDo you have an idea for systematic\/quantitative trading or investment strategy?

He suggested that investors consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as alternatives.\n\"If you want to own Marathon Digital, just go buy either Ethereum or buy Bitcoin, ok. Let's not fool around,\" Cramer said.\nMarathon Digital’s stock has experienced a tumultuous period, with its value dropping by over 20% in the past month.

On Tuesday, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the importance of Bitcoin’s $62,000 support level. Failure to maintain this level could shift focus to the next significant demand area, approximately $51,500. Conversely, a climb back above $66,250 could significantly boost the chances of a resurgence in the market.\nDespite concerns about the crypto market, Wall Street experts remain confident in the bull market‘s continuation. They cite a robust U.S. economy and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) as key drivers.\nOn the broader market front, Cramer has also outlined potential factors that could lead to further market decline, advising investors to be cautious about their buying and selling decisions. His recent advice regarding Marathon Digital is in line with his cautious approach to the current market conditions.\nPrice Action: While Marathon Digital Holdings closed at $14.63 on Wednesday, marking a modest 0.21% increase, the stock has experienced a significant decline of 36.20% year to date.

This milestone will automatically reduce the mining reward by 50%, decreasing from the current 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins.\nFor those new to the concept, this event is known as Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed occurrence after every 210,000 blocks, cutting the Bitcoin mining reward in half.\nSince the genesis of the first Bitcoin block on January 3, 2009, we’ve experienced three halving events so far. The initial reward of 50 Bitcoins per block has gradually decreased, and post the next halving, it will further reduce to 3.125 Bitcoins per block.\nBut this time around, leading up to the fourth halving in April 2024, the crypto landscape is unique.\nFor instance, Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, noted that prices surged to unprecedented levels just before the event, adding an intriguing dimension to post-halving market dynamics. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has attracted institutional players to the crypto ecosystem, enhancing market credibility and stability.\nBesides this, unlike previous halvings, the current ecosystem is more mature, with increased nuances and complexities.\nSidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of blockchain analytics firm CREBACO, believes that geopolitical events like the Iran-Israel conflict could destabilise matters. He added that the bull run, which is usually triggered by the halving event, has been triggered by the ETF approvals. So the cycle has been left-translated this time. Sogani expects the full impact to reveal itself by the end of May 2024.\nThe recent influx in its price underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global economy, paving the way for increased demand and utility. With Hong Kong’s recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, analysts anticipate a rise in global wealth managers’ exposure to Bitcoin as an asset class, particularly as investment managers look for an edge within their clients’ portfolios.\nIn a conversation with Inc42, Sumit Gupta, cofounder of CoinDCX, said that historically Bitcoin halvings have correlated with price surges. These increases are driven by a reduction in the supply issuance rate, emphasising Bitcoin’s scarcity, which in turn could drive up demand, prices, and trading activity.\nThe first halving in November 2012 saw the block reward decrease from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. In the year following this event, Bitcoin’s price soared from around $12 to over $1,000, marking an approximate 83x increase. Similar trends were observed after subsequent halvings.\nFollowing the July 2016 halving, where the reward was slashed from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, Bitcoin’s price surged from approximately $650 to a peak of around $20,000 in just 18 months, a nearly 30x increase, Gupta noted.\nDefining the short-term impact, Jyotsna Hirdyani, South Asia head at Bitget, also pointed out that typically six to 12 months after a halving, there’s a surge in price, leading the crypto market out of the medium and long-term bull market.\n“The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Although the immediate impact on price was less pronounced compared to previous halvings, we saw a steady upward trajectory in the following months. By early 2021, Bitcoin had reached new all-time highs, surpassing $60,000 per coin, marking a 5x increase from the pre-halving price around $12,000,” CoinDCX cofounder Gupta added.\nHowever, this time, opinions diverged among over a dozen crypto founders and experts Inc42 spoke to, with some highlighting different trajectories this time, attributing significance to other factors.\nAccording to Shivam Thakral, founder and CEO of BuyUcoin, the upcoming halving could have dual effects on the Indian market: a surge in prices due to decreased supply as coins become scarcer for mining, and short-term volatility due to anticipation and excitement surrounding the event. Traders could potentially buy in anticipation of price increases.\nThakral also noted that the predicted price increase of Bitcoin may entice new investors, consequently increasing the daily transaction volume. Thakral also highlighted the potential for increased adoption by Indian enterprises to drive up daily transactions.\nAccording to various research reports, each of the Bitcoin halvings in the past was followed by three stages — a one-year bull market,  a one-year bear market, followed by a two-year stagnation.\nHowever, the stance of the Indian government on cryptocurrencies could potentially temper investor enthusiasm, thereby affecting both price and transaction volume.\nBitcoin, as the foundational cryptocurrency, has been instrumental in shaping the entire crypto ecosystem. Hence, the impact of halving won’t be confined solely to Bitcoin but will extend to altcoins and other products like future ETFs and spot ETFs.\nSogani believes that the altcoin markets will also experience an upsurge post-halving, given that Bitcoin’s dominance stands at around 53% of the total market cap.\nWhen Bitcoin prices rise, investor attention is solely on Bitcoin, causing its dominance to climb to 56% to 70%. However, this dominance eventually stabilises as traders start capitalising on their Bitcoin gains, divesting some profits into altcoins.\nThis shift usually occurs after Bitcoin hits an all-time high. As the market has matured, this transition to altcoins can occur concurrently to a certain extent. Moreover, this trend could gain further momentum with the introduction of Ethereum ETFs, followed by potential offerings for other cryptocurrencies like Solana.\nIn addition to the potential impacts on altcoins, Bitcoin futures, and related products, new financial products are likely emerging in response to the dynamics surrounding the Bitcoin halving.\nDhruvil Shah, SVP of technology at Liminal Custody Solutions, believes that just as spot ETFs launch globally, innovative financial instruments may emerge, providing investors with alternative pathways to access digital assets.\nGupta of CoinDCX asserts that India is leading the charge in crypto adoption. The upcoming halving event has ignited excitement within the crypto community, prompting us to closely monitor market movements. The impact of the halving on Bitcoin’s price and daily transaction volume in the Indian market hinges on various factors, including regulatory developments and investor sentiment.\nThe Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will slash block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, reducing daily new Bitcoins from 900 BTC\/day to 450 BTC\/day. Gupta notes that this reduction may intensify competition among miners, potentially leading to consolidation as rewards decrease while operational costs remain high.\nEchoing Gupta’s sentiments, Hirdyani of Bitget anticipates a surge in trading volume fueled by positive sentiment towards crypto. “With the growing interest in cryptocurrencies in the country, we may witness increased trading activity and price appreciation, especially if Bitcoin continues its global trend of reaching new all-time highs,” she stated.\nIn contrast to previous instances, exchanges are refraining from aggressive advertising during the IPL season. This suggests that the observed growth is genuine and organic, albeit modest. CREBACO’s Sogani added, “While we lack concrete data for India, it’s apparent that exchanges aren’t as aggressively promoting during the IPL or through traditional media channels compared to the previous cycle in 2021. Hence, while growth is expected, it may not match the levels seen in the past.”\nThe total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 Mn, and it’s estimated that there will be around 33 halving events in total. The idea behind halving was to limit the supply and keep pushing the value of Bitcoin. Out of 21 Mn, 19.685 Mn Bitcoins have already been mined.\nIt’s no surprise, then, that halving events has a knock-on effect on Bitcoin’s price. While the miners will have lower profitability due to fewer blocks, increased competition, and transition to renewable energy and may have to bear an estimated loss of $ 10 Bn, the current Indian crypto community is battle hardened and remains vigilant.\nWhether it’s the surge in altcoin interest, the emergence of innovative financial products, or the evolving trading landscape in India, one thing is certain: the halving’s ripple effects will continue to shape the future of digital finance.\nThe RBI’s CBDC is just one example for now, believes the industry.\nJoin our exclusive community of 10,000+ founders, investors & operators and stay ahead in India’s startup & business economy.\nUnleash your potential by exploring unlimited articles, trackers, and playbooks.

According to the forecast, the cryptocurrency could experience a significant drop below the $60,000 mark before potentially witnessing a ‘hate halving rally.’\nWhat Happened: IncomeSharks took to X to share its forecast. The analyst suggested that Bitcoin might dip below the $60,000 level, which could prompt panic selling. The analyst believes that this would be a necessary step to clear out the remaining holders who are relying on the support to hold.\n“#Bitcoin – Still think we break and close below $60k to get another round of panic sellers gone. People probably still holding thinking support is holding. We need to break them first. Then we can get a hate halving rally,” the analyst said.\n#Bitcoin – Still think we break and close below $60k to get another round of panic sellers gone.

Many analysts and investors are closely watching to see how this event will impact the market. Some experts believe that the halving could transform the market and lead to a significant price increase.\nThe analyst’s prediction aligns with the recent market volatility. Ali Martinez, another crypto analyst, highlighted the $62,000 level as a critical support zone for Bitcoin. Failure to maintain this level could shift focus to the next significant demand area, around $51,500. However, Martinez also pointed out a potential trigger for a bullish trend. If Bitcoin manages to climb back above $66,250, it could significantly boost the chances of a resurgence in the market.\nMeanwhile, notable financial commentator Jim Cramer recently advised against investing in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA, a company involved in Bitcoin mining, and instead recommended Bitcoin or Ethereum ETH\/USD as alternatives.\nPrice Action: Bitcoin is currently trading at $61,562, showing a 0.48% increase in the last 24 hours and a notable 39.37% gain year to date, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next: Shiba Inu Down 20% On The Week, But: These ‘Proven Milestones’ Could Lead To ‘Massive Bull Market,’ Touts\nImage Via Shutterstock\nEngineered by\n        Benzinga Neuro, Edited by\n        \n\n              Kaustubh Bagalkote\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the\n        extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to\n        create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n        Learn more.\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Among these are Bitcoin's upcoming halving  event, Ethereum's current price fluctuations due to significant whale  activity, and the rise of new players like Furrever Token (FURR), which seeks to carve out a niche with its unique approach and potential high returns.\nJPMorgan Cautions Against Expecting a Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving Event\nAs  the cryptocurrency community braces for this year’s Bitcoin halving  event, scheduled around April 19-20, JPMorgan has issued a less than  optimistic forecast. Contrary to the significant price surges that  followed previous halvings, the banking giant predicts that Bitcoin  might not only fail to rally but could potentially see a decline in  value.\nIn the past, Bitcoin halvings have been pivotal moments  that typically led to bullish market behavior. The process involves  halving the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, thereby reducing the  rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This mechanism serves as a  counter to inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, such  events have boosted the cryptocurrency's market price significantly  within a year of occurrence. For instance, after the 2012 halving,  Bitcoin's price increased from $12 to $135 over the next 300 days.\nHowever,  this year's scenario presents a unique backdrop. According to  JPMorgan’s analysis, the current market conditions are \"overbought\".  Bitcoin's price, hovering around $61,200, is well above the $45,000 mark  when adjusted for volatility in comparison with gold. This elevated  baseline, combined with the peak price reached a month before the  halving—a first in Bitcoin’s history—suggests a different outcome might  be unfolding this time around.\nAdding to the cautious outlook,  Goldman Sachs has also advised prudence. The firm highlighted the  unpredictable macroeconomic factors currently at play, which could  influence Bitcoin's performance differently compared to past cycles.  Despite previous patterns of price appreciation post-halving, Goldman  Sachs warns against assuming similar outcomes this year, given the  distinct global economic conditions.\nThis tempered expectation  marks a significant shift in sentiment among financial giants regarding  the crypto market's behavior following the halving. As the event nears,  the cryptocurrency community and investors are keeping a watchful eye,  prepared for a range of possibilities that diverge from the historical  norm.\nEthereum Price Volatility Continues as ICO Whale Offloads Significant ETH Holdings\nThe  Ethereum market is currently experiencing heightened volatility,  underscored by a recent 4% drop in price amid broader crypto market  fluctuations. This latest dip has triggered a wave of speculation about  the future price movements of Ethereum.\nKey to the current market  unrest is the activity of an ICO whale who has significantly reduced  their holdings, selling off 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at a rate of  $2,997 each. This move comes after additional transactions where the  same whale offloaded 5,110 ETH on various platforms, with the price per  ETH approximately at $2,545. Despite this large-scale sell-off, the  whale still possesses about 29,700 ETH, which currently values  approximately $89.4 million, held primarily across staking platforms.\nAdding  to the market’s unease, Whale Alert has flagged more Ethereum moving  towards exchanges. Notably, an unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH to  Coinbase, worth roughly $32.13 million, followed by another transaction  of 10,726 ETH to the same exchange, valued at around $31.90 million.\nThese  substantial movements to a major exchange like Coinbase are raising  alarms about potential further increases in Ethereum’s price volatility.  However, amid these concerns, some analysts maintain a cautious  optimism, buoyed by positive developments such as the recent approval of  Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which may indicate a rebound or  stabilization in the market soon.\nMoreover, with the  cryptocurrency community looking forward to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving  event, there is anticipation that this might also spur positive  movements in Ethereum's price.\nAs the situation develops,  Ethereum's current trading price stands at $2,978.31, marking a decrease  of 3.45% from the previous day, with a trading volume that has risen by  10.77% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, Ethereum's price has seen a  substantial 16% decline over the past week and an 18% drop over the last  month, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty and the speculative nature  of the crypto market.\nFurrever Token Emerges as a Strong Contender Against Established Cryptocurrencies\nIn the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR)  is carving out a niche for itself with a current price of $0.000564 and  promising features that could potentially outperform major players like  Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON). What sets Furrever Token apart is its  unique appeal rooted in the universal love for cute kitties, aiming to  create a delightful and engaging experience for its users.\nThe  charm of Furrever Token extends beyond its cat-themed aesthetics,  encompassing a range of stickers, emojis, and visuals that enhance the  user interface.

About 65% of its  tokens were made available during the presale, with the remainder  distributed between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the development  team. This distribution strategy promotes fairness and ensures the  longevity and stability of the project.\nFinancially, Furrever  Token is not just about the novelty; it offers significant return  potential, boasting up to 15X returns which highlights its  attractiveness as an investment. To secure its platform and user  investments, the token has undergone rigorous audits, emphasizing its  commitment to security and compliance.\nThe project’s dedication is  further evidenced by its active community engagement and transparent  communication, critical factors that contribute to its growing  legitimacy and appeal as an investment.\nAs Furrever Token  continues to evolve and attract attention in the crypto market, its  innovative integration of fun elements with serious financial prospects  positions it as a formidable alternative to well-established  cryptocurrencies like Solana and Toncoin.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has shown a slight strength against BTC even as the chances of ETF approval in May has been considerably low,” the CoinSwitch Markets Desk told Gadgets360. “Bitcoin's 200-day average price, one of the most tracked indicators, is reaching its highest levels in more than two years. As far as Ether is concerned, the year-end pricing target stands at $8,000 (roughly Rs. 6.66 lakh).”\nAmongst most cryptocurrencies that are reflecting losses on Wednesday, Tether, Ripple, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Avalanche, and Polkadot marked their names.\nChainlink, Near Protocol, Cronos, Stellar, and Cosmos also settled in losses.\n“Altcoins showed mixed results. Meme coins like Bonk and Pepe are currently leading the market. However, there's a concern regarding Mt. Gox's plan to distribute cryptocurrencies, including a substantial amount of BTC and yen, by October 2024. Some creditors anticipate earlier payouts, while others fear selling pressure in October,” the CoinDCX team told Gadgets360.\nMeanwhile, Binance Coin, Solana, Dogecoin, Tron, Polygon, and Litecoin reflected minor gains alongside Leo and Uniswap.\nMinor profits were also recorded by EOS Coin, Ardor, Iota, and Zcash.\n“Solana has surpassed its resistance at $150 and is showing signs of further rally. The next resistance is perceived to be at $161 if the current trading volumes persists. XRP has been able to keep its steady momentum despite its ongoing legal tussle with the SEC. It seems to have minimal effect on the investors. The crypto market seems to be on a steady trajectory after its retracement right before the halving,” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets360.\nThe overall market cap of the crypto sector rose by 1.37 percent in the last 24 hours. With this, the crypto market valuation stands at $2.47 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,05,73,988 crore), showed CoinMarketCap.\nCryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.

Observe that we in early 2021 had a strong correction. We believe that was a wave four. We now have a similar strong decline. More upside is coming. This index and our Fibonacci levels give us [reason to believe] we may see ~350% upside from current levels.”\nThe founders recently said another bullish catalyst for the crypto market is the waning strength of the US dollar index (DYX).\nAccording to the analysts, the DXY likely printed a top earlier this month in an expanding diagonal pattern, implying that a significant downward move is underway, which may be a catalyst for a renewed bull market for Bitcoin (BTC).\nThe founders also weigh in on what they believe are the price impacts from the spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They say that ETF investors are reactionary to price declines, but not a cause of them.\n“The significant volume handled by ETFs also highlights their potential as catalysts in the market, potentially driving both short-term price movements and long-term strategic shifts in investment and trading behaviors. So far, however, significant ETF outflows often align with notable price drops in the Bitcoin market, indicating that investors tend to react to existing downturns rather than causing them.\nThis suggests a predominantly reactive investor behavior in times of market volatility, which is crucial for understanding the causality of price movements.”\nBitcoin is trading for $66,434 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nCategories\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nJOIN US ON X\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl"]}

Most notably, flagship cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are signaling bearish trends, casting a shadow over the broader market sentiment. Despite this downturn, amidst the turbulence, emerges Furrever Token (FURR), captivating investors with the allure of a promising 15X return on investment (ROI). Let's delve into the recent developments shaping these contrasting narratives within the crypto landscape.\nBitcoin Faces Uncertainty: Can it Overcome Bearish Pressures Amidst Market Volatility?\nWith Bitcoin's price hovering below $64,000, experiencing a 4% decline since yesterday, investors are grappling with uncertainty regarding its trajectory. Initially anticipated to benefit from positive sentiments fueled by stock market support earlier this week, Bitcoin's outlook has been tempered by underwhelming ETF data. Moreover, Friday's impending release of the PCE data promises to shed light on the Federal Reserve's stance on inflation control, a pivotal factor influencing market dynamics.\nCompounded by lingering concerns over persistently poor inflation data over the past three months, speculations of a potential 25bp rate hike have replaced previous expectations of a rate cut. The failure to address inflationary pressures has been further exacerbated by recent tensions between Iran and Israel, adding geopolitical risk to an already volatile environment. Additionally, Genesis outflows accelerating through the ETF channel have yet to fully reverse, indicating lingering apprehension among traditional investors and hindering Bitcoin's upward momentum.\nWith Bitcoin's failure to initiate the desired bullish trend post-halving, a retest of the $60,000 support level looms, with potential closures below $63,224 targeting the $59,750 region, a move that could trigger double-digit losses in altcoins.\nEthereum Faces Bearish Signals: Will it Hold Key Support Levels Amidst Market Turbulence?\nIn recent days, developments in the Ethereum market have sparked concern and speculation among investors who are closely monitoring the pulse of the cryptocurrency world. Unable to surpass the $3,280 resistance zone, Ethereum's price retreated below the $3,200 support level, currently consolidating losses above $3,100. Struggles to breach the $3,250 and $3,280 resistance levels have instilled a noticeable sense of resistance in the market, compounded by trading below $3,200 and slipping below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average, stirring apprehension among investors.\nA breakdown below the critical uptrend line around the $3,190 support on the ETH\/USD hourly chart signifies a strengthening bearish momentum. Concerns mount if the pair trades below $3,100 support, signaling a potential continuation of downward movement. Ethereum's failure to overcome the $3,250 and $3,280 resistance levels has initiated a new downtrend, with ETH slipping below the $3,200 support into a short-term bearish trend. Particularly worrisome is the breach of the significant uptrend line support at $3,190 on the four-hour ETH\/USD chart, prompting market apprehension.\nThe pair retraced to test $3,100, finding some stability around the low level of $3,105, currently consolidating losses at these levels. Immediate resistance lies around $3,180, just below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average, while major resistance is near $3,200 or the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline at $3,291. The next key resistance sits at $3,220, above which the price may attract interest towards $3,250. A successful close above $3,250 could test the $3,280 resistance, potentially paving the way for Ethereum to target the $3,500 resistance zone.\nFurrever Token (FURR) Attracts Huge Waves of Investors During Hard Times\nDespite the prevailing market downturn and heightened volatility, Furrever Token (FURR) continues to attract investors through its unique value proposition and strategic approach. FURR distinguishes itself by infusing the crypto space with a refreshing dose of cuteness, offering users an enjoyable and light-hearted experience, unlike traditional blockchain projects. With a mission to create a whimsical and heartwarming crypto ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery, FURR aims to foster a sense of community and shared joy among its users.\nOne of the key factors contributing to FURR's appeal is its transparent tokenomics and commitment to project longevity. With a total token supply of around 9 billion tokens, FURR allocates 65% of tokens for the presale, ensuring ample opportunity for early investors to participate. Additionally, the team locks 10% of tokens for a year, reassuring the community of their dedication to the project's success.\nFURR's roadmap emphasizes user engagement and community building, featuring regular challenges, launches, and growth initiatives to encourage active participation and interaction. The integration of cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals further enhances the user experience, fostering a warm and friendly atmosphere within the FURR community.\nFurthermore, FURR's successful fundraising efforts, having raised over $1 million in just two months with ongoing presale stages, underscore investor confidence in the project's potential. The decision to launch on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PancakeSwap further enhances accessibility and liquidity for investors.\nAmidst the broader market challenges, FURR's emphasis on fun, security, and compliance remains unwavering. The project conducts audits and implements safety measures to ensure a secure and enjoyable experience for all users. Additionally, the active engagement of admins and moderators on platforms like Telegram, coupled with organic community growth, reflects a strong commitment to fostering a vibrant and supportive ecosystem.\nAs of the latest update, FURR's current price stands at $0.000648.

The distribution can play a large part in the trading dynamics of the asset as well as broader market sentiment. Additionally, because blockchain technology is entirely public, the distribution of holders is known, offering unparalleled insights into Bitcoin's dynamics.\nDon't Miss:\nAbout 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\nBitcoin To $100,000? Here’s what gold bug Peter Schiff said could happen on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast.\nBitcoin (BTC) and crypto, in general, are known to have many large holders — sometimes referred to as whales — who influence the price with large trades. Others can see these trades and make moves in response, often creating more volatility. Additionally, some whales acquire tokens and hold them for long periods. This can effectively lower the amount of the token supply that can be traded, which can have a positive impact on the price. Large token holders can have a huge impact on the price of Bitcoin.\nThe price of Bitcoin has gone up astronomically over the past decade. This has allowed some small investors at the beginning of BTC's history to amass huge wallets. Since its launch, Bitcoin is up more than 575,000%. A handful of institutions have gotten involved with Bitcoin in recent years. Some examples include MicroStrategy Inc., which owns more than 1% of the total supply, as well as BlackRock Inc., which launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) earlier this year. The largest Bitcoin holders are a mix of early investors and institutional buyers.\nWith that in mind, the actual numbers behind the Bitcoin distribution are still surprising:\n46.8 million wallet addresses have more than $1.\n10,000 wallets have more than $10 million in Bitcoin.\n100,000 wallets have more than $1 million.\nThe top 105 wallets hold nearly 3 million BTC, which is roughly 15% of the total supply.\nThe top 2,000 wallets hold 40% of the total supply.\nThe smallest 25% of addresses hold less than 0.03% of the supply.\nThe largest wallet address holds ~250,000 BTC or 1.26% of the total supply.\nWhile this may seem extremely concentrated, it is less concentrated than other cryptocurrencies. For example, the largest 15 Dogecoin (DOGE) wallets account for 50% of the total supply. Bitcoin is still very concentrated as compared to most other assets.\nAdditionally, the data does not paint the true picture of Bitcoin supply. Some investors hold their tokens across many wallet addresses. For example, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, allegedly holds 600,000-1.1 million BTC across an estimated 20,000 wallet addresses. While he is likely the largest holder, it does not show up in the distribution because it is spread across a huge number of wallets.\nEven though the Bitcoin chain is entirely public and viewable, there are still ways to get around it. This ultimately means that the supply of Bitcoin is even more concentrated than the surface-level distribution.\nRead Next:\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.\nLarge boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Bitcoin Millionaires Revealed: How Many Investors Hold $1 Million Or More In BTC? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.
